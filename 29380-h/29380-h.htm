<p>He trotted upstairs. Perhaps trotting is not quite
the right word, but I can't find a better. It wasn't
at all like a horse or pony trotting, for he went one
foot at a time, right foot first, and when right foot
was safely landed on a step, up came left foot and
the rest of Baby himself after right foot. It took a
good while, but Baby didn't mind. He used to think
a good deal while he was going up and down stairs,
and it was not his way to be often in a hurry. There
was one thing he could <i>not</i> bear, and that was any
one trying to carry him upstairs. Oh, that did vex
him! His face used to get quite red, right up to the
roots of his curly hair, and down to the edge of the
big collar of his sailor suit, for he had been put into
sailor suits last Christmas, and, if the person who was
lifting him up didn't let go all at once, Baby would
begin to wriggle. He was really clever at wriggling;
even if you knew his way it was not easy to hold
him, and with any one that didn't know his way he
could get off in half a minute.</p>

<p>But this time there was no one about, and Baby
stumped on&mdash;yes <i>that</i> is a better word&mdash;Baby stumped
on, or up, "wifout nobody teasing." His face was
grave, very grave, for inside the little house of which
his two blue eyes were the windows, a great deal of
work was going on. He was busy wondering about,
and trying to understand, some of the strange news
he had heard downstairs in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Over the sea," he said to himself. "Him would
like to see the sea. Auntie said over the sea in a
boat, a werry big boat. Him wonders how big."</p>

<p>And his mind went back to the biggest boat he
had ever seen, which was in the toy-shop at Brookton,
when he had gone with his mother to be fitted for
new boots. But even that wouldn't be big enough.
Mother, and auntie, and grandfather, and Celia, and
Fritz, and Denny, and cook, and Lisa, and Thomas
and Jones, and the other servants, and the horses,
and&mdash;and<span class="norewrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Baby stopped to take breath inside,
for though he had not been speaking aloud he felt
quite choked with all the names coming so fast.
"And pussy, and the calanies, and the Bully, and
Fritz's dormice, oh no, them <i>couldn't</i> all get in." Perhaps
if Baby doubled up his legs underneath he
might squeeze himself in, but that would be no good,
he couldn't go sailing, sailing all over the sea by
himself, like the old woman in "Harry's Nursery
Songs," who went sailing, sailing, up in a basket,
"seventy times as high as the moon." Oh no, even
that boat wouldn't be big enough. They must have
one as big as&mdash;and Baby stopped to look round.
But just then a shout from inside the nursery made
him wake up, for he had got to the last little stair
before the top landing, and again right foot and half
Baby, followed by left foot and the other half Baby,
stumped on their way.</p>

<p>They pulled up&mdash;right foot and left foot, with
Baby's solemn face top of all&mdash;at the nursery door.
It was shut. Now one of the things Baby liked to
do for himself was to open doors, and now and then
he could manage it very well. But, alas, the nursery
lock was too high up for him to get a good hold of it.
He pulled, and pushed, and got quite red, all for no
use. Worse than that, the pushing and pulling were
heard inside. Some one came forward and opened
the door, nearly knocking poor Baby over.</p>

<p>"Ach, Herr Baby, mine child, why you not say
when you come?" Lisa cried out. Lisa was Baby's
nurse. Her face was rosy and round, and she looked
very kind. She would have liked to pick him up to
make sure he had got no knocks, but she knew too
well that would not do. So all she could do was to
say again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mine child&mdash;ach, Herr Baby!"</p>

<p>Baby did not take any notice.</p>

<p>"Zeally," he said coolly, "ganfather must do
somesing to zem locks. Zem is all most dedful
'tiff."</p>

<p>Lisa smiled to herself. She was used to Baby's
ways.</p>

<p>"Herr Baby shall grow tall some day," she said.
"Zen him can open doors."</p>

<p>Lisa's talking was nearly as funny as Baby's, and,
indeed, I rather think that hers had made his all the
funnier. But, any way, they understood each other.
He was thinking over what she had said, when a
scream from the nursery made them both turn round
in a hurry.</p>

<p>"O Lisa, O Baby, come in quick, do. Peepy-Snoozle
has got out of the cage, and he'll be out at
the door in another moment. Quick, quick, come in
and shut the door."</p>

<p>Lisa and Baby did not wait to be twice told.
Inside the nursery there was a great flurry. Celia,
Fritz, and Denny were all there crawling over the
floor and screaming at each other.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have him! there&mdash;oh, now that's too bad.
Fritz, you frightened him away again," called out
Celia.</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i> frighten him away! Why he knows me
ever so much better than you girls," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"He just doesn't then," said Denny with triumph,
"for here he is safe in my apron."</p>

<p>But she had hardly said the words when she gave
a little scream. "He's off again, oh quick, Baby,
quick, catch him."</p>

<p>How Baby did it, I can't tell. His hands seemed
too small to catch anything, even a dormouse. But
catch the truant he did, and very proud Baby looked
when he held up his two little fists, which he had
made into a "mouse-trap" <i>really</i>, for the occasion,
with Peepy-Snoozle's "coxy" little head and bright
beady eyes poking out at the top.</p>

<p>"Oh look, look, Baby's made Peepy-Snoozle into
'the parson in the pulpit that couldn't say his
prayers,'" cried Denny, dancing about.</p>

<p>"All the same, he'd better go back into his cage,"
said Fritz, who had a right to be heard, as he was
the master and owner of the dormice. "Come along,
Baby, poke him in."</p>

<p>Baby was busy kissing and petting Peepy-Snoozle
by this time, for, though he did not approve of much
of that sort of thing for himself, he was very fond of
petting little animals, who were not little boys. And
to tell the truth, it was not often he got a chance
of petting his big brother's dormice. It was quite
pretty to see the way he kissed Peepy-Snoozle's soft
brown head, especially his nose, stroking it gently
against his own smooth cheeks and chattering to the
little creature.</p>

<p>"Dear little darling. Sweet little denkle darling,"
he said. "Him would like to have a house all full
of Peepy-'noozles, zem is so sweet and soft."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a coat made of their skins?"
said Denny. "Think how soft that would be."</p>

<p>"No, sairtin him wouldn't," said Baby. "Him
wouldn't pull off all their sweet little skins and hairs
to make him a coat. Denny's a c'uel girl."</p>

<p>"There won't be much more skin or hairs left if
you go on scrubbing him up and down with your
sharp little nose like that," said Fritz.</p>

<p>Baby drew back his face in a fright.</p>

<p>"Put him in the cage then," he said, and with
Fritz's help this was safely done. Then Baby stood
silent, slowly rubbing his own nose up and down,
and looking very grave.</p>

<p>"Him's nose <i>isn't</i> sharp," he said at last, turning
upon Denny. "Sharp means knifes and scidders."</p>

<p>All the children burst out laughing. Of course
they understood things better than Baby, for even
Denny, the youngest next to him, was nine, that is
twice his age, which by the by was a puzzle to Denny
herself, for Celia had teased her one day by saying
that according to that when Baby was eighty Denny
would be a hundred and sixty, and nobody ever
lived to be so old, so how could it be.</p>

<p>But Denny, though she didn't <i>always</i> understand
everything herself, was very quick at taking up other
people if they didn't.</p>

<p>"Oh, you stupid little goose," she said. "Of
course, Fritz didn't mean as sharp as a knife.
There's different kinds of sharps&mdash;there's different
kinds of everything."</p>

<p>Baby looked at her gravely. He had his own
way of defending himself.</p>

<p>"Werry well. If him's a goose him won't talk to
you, and him won't tell you somesing <i>werry</i> funny and
dedful bootiful that him heard in the 'groind room."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on Baby.</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us, Baby darling, <i>do</i> tell us," said
Celia and Denny.</p>

<p>Fritz gave Baby a friendly pat on the back.</p>

<p>"You'll tell <i>me</i>, old fellow, won't you?" he said.
Baby looked at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said at last; "him will tell you,'cos
you let him have Peepy-'noozle, and 'cos you doesn't
call him a goose&mdash;like <i>girls</i> does. I'll whister in
your ear, Fritz, if you'll bend down."</p>

<p>But Celia thought this was too bad.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> didn't call you a goose, Baby," she said. "I
think you might tell me too."</p>

<p>"And I'll promise never to call you a goose again
if you'll tell <i>me</i>," said Denny.</p>

<p>Baby had a great soul. It was beneath him to
take a mean revenge, he felt, especially on a <i>girl</i>!
So he shut his little mouth tightly, knit his little
brows, and thought it over for a moment or two.
Then his face cleared.</p>

<p>"Him <i>will</i> tell you all&mdash;all you children," he said
at last, "but it's werry long and dedful wonderful,
and you mustn't inrumpt him. P'omise?"</p>

<p>"Promise," shouted the three.</p>

<p>"Well then, litsen. We's all goin' away&mdash;zeally
away&mdash;over the sea&mdash;dedful far. As far as the sky,
p'raps."</p>

<p>"In a balloon?" said Denny, whose tongue
wouldn't keep still even though she was very much
interested in the news.</p>

<p>"No, in a boat," replied Baby, forgetting to notice
that this was an "inrumption," "in a werry 'normous
boat. All's going. Him was looking for 'tamps in
mother's basket of teared letters under the little table,
and mother and ganfather and auntie didn't know
him were there, and ganfather said to mother somesing
him couldn't understand&mdash;somesing about <i>thit</i>
house, and mother said, yes, 'twould be a werry good
thing to go away 'fore the cold weather comed, and
the children would be p'eased. And auntie said she
would like to tell the children, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another "inrumption." This time from Fritz.</p>

<p>"Baby, stop a minute," he exclaimed. "Celia,
Denny&mdash;Baby's too little to understand, but," and
here Fritz's round chubby face got very red, "don't
you think we've no right to let him tell, if it's something
mother means to tell us herself? She didn't
know Baby was there&mdash;he said so."</p>

<p>But before Celia or Denny could answer, Baby
turned upon Fritz.</p>

<p>"Him <i>tolded</i> you not to inrumpt," he said, with
supreme contempt. "If you would litsen you would
see. Mother <i>did</i> know him was there at the ending,
for auntie said she'd like to tell the children&mdash;that's
you, and Denny and Celia&mdash;but him comed out from
the little table and said <i>him</i> would like to tell the
children hisself. And mother were dedful surprised,
and so was ganfather and auntie. And then they all
bursted out laughing and told him lots of things&mdash;about
going in the railway, and in a 'normous boat
to that other country, where there's cows to pull the
carts, and all the people talk lubbish-talk, like Lisa
when she's cross. And zen, and zen, him comed upstairs
to tell you."</p>

<p>Baby looked round triumphantly. Celia and
Fritz and Denny looked first at him and then at
each other. This was wonderful news&mdash;almost too
wonderful to be true.</p>

<p>"We must be going to Italy or somewhere like
that," said Celia. "How lovely! I wonder why
they didn't tell us before?"</p>

<p>"Italy," repeated Denny, "that's the country like
a boot, isn't it? I do hope there won't be any snakes.
I'd rather far stay at home than go where there's
snakes."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't," said Fritz, grandly. "I'd like to
go to India or Africa, or any of those places where
there's lots of lions and tigers and snakes, and anything
you like. Give me a good revolver and <i>you'd</i>
see."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Fritz," said Celia. "You're
far too little a boy for shooting and guns and all
that. It's setting a bad example to Baby to talk that
boasting way, and it's very silly too."</p>

<p>"Indeed, miss. Much obliged to you, miss," said
Fritz. "I'd only just like to know, miss, who it was
came to my room the other night and was sure she
heard robbers, and begged Fritz to peep behind the
swing-door in the long passage. And 'oh,' said this
person, 'I do so wish you had a gun that you could
point at them to frighten them away.' Fritz wasn't
such a very little boy just then."</p>

<p>Celia's face got rather red, and she looked as if
she was going to get angry, but at that moment,
happily, Lisa appeared with the tray for the nursery
tea. She had left the room when the dormouse was
caught, so she had not heard the wonderful news, and it
had all to be told over again. She smiled and seemed
pleased, but not as surprised as the children expected.</p>

<p>"Why, aren't you surprised, Lisa?" said the
children. "Did you know before? Why didn't
you tell us?"</p>

<p>Lisa shook her head and looked very wise.</p>

<p>"What country are we going to? Can you tell
us that?" said Celia.</p>

<p>"Is it to your country? Is it to what you call
Dutchland?" said Fritz. "I think it's an awfully
queer thing that countries can't be called by the same
names everywhere. It makes geography ever so
much harder. We've got to call the people that live
in Holland Dutch, and they call themselves&mdash;oh, I
don't know what they call themselves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hollanders," said Lisa.</p>

<p>"Hollanders!" repeated Fritz. "Well, that's a
sensible sort of name for people that live in Holland.
But <i>we've</i> got to call them Dutch; and then, to make
it more muddled still, Lisa calls her country Dutchland,
and the people Dutch, and <i>we</i> call them German
I think it's very stupid. If I was to make geography
I wouldn't do it that way."</p>

<p>"What's jography?" said Baby.</p>

<p>"Knowing all about all the countries and all the
places in the world," said Denny.</p>

<p>"Him wants to learn that," said Baby.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're <i>far</i> too little!" said Denny. "<i>I</i> only
began it last year. Oh, you're ever so much too
little!"</p>

<p>"Him's not too little to go in the 'normous boat
to <i>see</i> all zem countlies," said Baby, valiantly. "Him
<i>will</i> learn jography."</p>

<p>"That's right, Baby," said Fritz. "Stick up for
yourself. You'll be a great deal bigger than Denny
some day."</p>

<p>Denny was getting ready an answer when Lisa,
who knew pretty well the signs of war between Fritz
and Denny, called to all the children to come to tea;
and as both Fritz and Denny were great hands at
bread and butter, they forgot to quarrel, and began
pulling their chairs in to the table, and in a few
minutes all four were busy at work.</p>

<p>What a pretty sight, and what a pleasant thing a
nursery tea is! when the children, that is to say,
are sweet-faced and smiling, with clean pinafores,
and clean hands, and gentle voices; not leaning over
the table, knocking over cups, and snatching rudely
at the "butteriest" pieces of bread and butter, and
making digs at the sugar when nurse is not looking.
<i>That</i> kind of nursery tea is not to my mind, and not
at all the kind to which I am always delighted to
receive an invitation, written in very round, very
black letters, on very small sheets of paper. The
nursery teas in Baby's nursery were not always <i>quite</i>
what I like to see them, for Celia, Fritz, and Denny,
and Baby too, had their tiresome days as well as
their pleasant ones, and though they meant to be
good to each other, they did not <i>always</i> do just what
they meant, or really wished, at the bottom of their
hearts. But to-day all the little storms were forgotten
in the great news, and all the faces looked
bright and eager, though just at first not much was
said, for when children are hungry of course they
can't chatter quite so fast, and all the four tongues
were silent till at least one cup of tea, and perhaps
three or four slices of bread and butter each&mdash;just as
a beginning, you know&mdash;had disappeared.</p>

<p>Then said Celia,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lisa, do tell us if you know what sort of a place
we're going to."</p>

<p>"Cows pulls carts there," observed Baby; "and&mdash;and&mdash;what
was the 'nother thing? We'll have frogses
for dinner."</p>

<p>"Baby!" said the others, "<i>what nonsense</i>!"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't nonsense. Ganfather said Thomas and
Dones wouldn't go 'cos they was fightened of frogses for
dinner. <i>Him</i> doesn't care&mdash;frogses tastes werry good."</p>

<p>"How do you know? You've never tasted them,"
said Fritz.</p>

<p>"Ganfather said zem was werry good."</p>

<p>"Grandfather was joking," said Celia. "I've
often heard him laugh at people that way. It's just
nonsense&mdash;Thomas and Jones don't know any better.
Do they eat frogs in your country, Lisa?"</p>

<p>"In mine country, Fr&auml;ulein C&eacute;lie?" said Lisa,
looking rather vexed. "No indeed. Man eats goot,
most goot tings, in mine country. Say, Herr Baby&mdash;Herr
Baby knows what goot tings Lisa would give
him in her country."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby, "such good tings. Tocolate
and cakes&mdash;lots&mdash;and bootiful soup, all sweet, not
like salty soup. Him would like werry much to go
to Lisa's countly."</p>

<p>"Do cows pull carts in your country, Lisa?"
asked Denny.</p>

<p>"Some parts. Not where mine family lives," said
Lisa. "No, Fr&auml;ulein Denny, it's not to mine country
we're going. Mine country is it colt, so colt;
and your lady mamma and your lady auntie they
want to go where it is warm, so warm, and sun all
winter."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should like that too," said Celia, "I hate
winter."</p>

<p>"That's 'cos you're a girl," said Fritz; "you
crumple yourself up by the fire and sit shivering&mdash;no
wonder you're cold. You should come out skating
like Denny, and then you'd get warm."</p>

<p>"Denny's a girl too. You said it was because I
was a girl," said Celia.</p>

<p>"Well, she's not as silly as some girls, any way,"
said Fritz, rather "put down."</p>

<p>Baby was sitting silent. He had made an end of
two cups of tea and five pieces of bread and butter.</p>

<p>He was not, therefore, <i>quite</i> so hungry as he had
been at the beginning, but still he was a long way off
having made what was called in the nursery a "good
tea." Something was on his mind. He sat with one
arm propped on the table, and his round head leaning
on his hand, while the other held the piece of
bread and butter&mdash;butter downwards, of course&mdash;which
had been on its way to his mouth when his
brown study had come over him.</p>

<p>"Herr Baby," said Lisa, "eat, mine child."</p>

<p>Baby took no notice.</p>

<p>"What has he then?" said Lisa, who was very
easily frightened about her dear Herr Baby. "Can
he be ill? He eats not."</p>

<p>"Ill," said Celia. "No fear, Lisa. He's had ever
so much bread and butter. Don't you want any more,
Baby? What are you thinking about? We're going
to have honey on our last pieces to-night, aren't we,
Lisa? For a treat, you know, because of the news of
going away."</p>

<p>Celia wanted the honey because she was very fond
of it; but besides that, she thought it would wake
Baby out of his brown study to hear about it, for he
was very fond of it too.</p>

<p>He did catch the word, for he turned his blue
eyes gravely on Celia.</p>

<p>"Honey's werry good," he said, "but him's not at
his last piece yet. Him doesn't sink he'll <i>ever</i> be at
his last piece to-night; him's had to stop eating for
he's so dedful busy in him's head."</p>

<p>"Poor little man, have you got a pain in your head?"
said his sister, kindly. "Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Baby, softly shaking his head, "no
pain. It's only busy sinking."</p>

<p>"What about?" said all the children.</p>

<p>Baby sat straight up.</p>

<p>"Children," he said, "him zeally can't eat, sinking
of what a dedful packing there'll be. All of everysing.
Him zeally sinks it would be best to begin
to-night."</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened. It was mother.
She often came up to the nursery at tea-time, and</p>

<p class="noindent">I need hardly say, they were very, very pleased to
see her. Indeed there were times even when they
were glad to see her face at the door when they
<i>hadn't</i> been very good, for somehow she had a way
of putting things right again, and making them feel
both how wrong and how <i>silly</i> it is to be cross and
quarrelsome, that nobody else had. And she would
just help the kind words out without seeming to do
so, and take away that sore, horrid feeling that one
<i>can't</i> be good, even though one is longing so to be
happy and friendly again.</p>

<p>But this evening there had been nothing worse
than a little squabbling; the children all greeted
mother merrily, only Baby still looked rather
solemn.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" they all cried with one voice,
and the three big ones jumped up and ran to her, all
pulling her at once.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, do sit down in the rocking-chair
and look comfortable," said Fritz.</p>

<p>"There's still some tea. You'll have a cup of <i>our</i>
tea, won't you, mother?" said Celia.</p>

<p>"And some bread and honey," said Denny.</p>

<p>"It won't spoil your afternoon tea; don't say it
will," said all together, for nothing would ever make
them believe that when mother came up to the
nursery at tea-time it could be allowed that she
should not have a share of whatever there was.</p>

<p>"Such a good thing we had honey to-night," said
Celia, who was busy cutting a very dainty piece of
bread and butter. "We persuaded Lisa to give it us
<i>extra</i>, you know, mother, because of the news. And,
oh, mother, what do you think Baby says? he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baby! what is the matter with him?" interrupted
mother.</p>

<p>They all turned to look at him. Poor Baby, he
had set to work to get down from his chair to run to
mother with the others, but the chair was high and
Baby was short, and Lisa, who had gone to the cupboard
for a fresh cup and saucer for "madame," as
she called the children's mother, had not noticed the
trouble Herr Baby had got himself into. One little
leg and a part of his body were stuck fast in the open
space between the bars at the back, his head had
somehow got under the arm of the chair, and could
not be got out again without help. And Baby was
far too proud to call out for help as long as there was
a chance of his doing without it. But he really was
in a very uncomfortable state, and it was a wonder
that the chair, which was a light wicker one, had not
toppled over with the queer way in which he was
hanging. They got him out at last; his face was
very red, and I <i>think</i> the tears had been very near
coming, but he choked them down, and looking up
gravely he said to his mother,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Him's chair is getting too small. Him hasn't
room to turn."</p>

<p>"Is it really?" said his mother, quite gravely too.
She saw that Celia and Fritz were ready to burst out
laughing at poor Baby, and she didn't want them to
do so, for Baby had really been very brave, and now
when he was trying hard not to cry it would have
been too bad to laugh at him. "Is it really?" she
said. "I must see about it, and if it is too small we
must get you another."</p>

<p>"Him doesn't want you to pack up <i>that</i> chair,"
said Baby again, giving himself a sort of shake, as if
to make sure that his head, and his legs, and all the
rest of him, were in their proper places after being
so turned about and twisted by his struggles in the
chair.</p>

<p>"He's quite in a fuss about packing," said Celia;
"that's what I was going to tell you, mother. He
stopped in the middle of his tea to think about it, and
he said he thought we'd better begin to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby. "There's such <i>lots</i> to pack.
All our toys, and the labbits, and the mouses, and
the horses, and the fireplaces, and the tables, and the
cups, and the saucers," his eyes wandering round the
room as he went on with his list. "Him thinks
we'll need <i>lots</i> of boats to go in."</p>

<p>"And two or three railway trains all to ourselves,"
said mother.</p>

<p>Baby looked up at her gravely. He could not
make out if mother was in fun or earnest. His little
puzzled face made mother draw him to her and give
him a kiss.</p>

<p>"It's a shame to talk nonsense to such a serious
little man," she said. "Don't trouble yourself about
the packing, Baby dear. Don't you know grandfather,
and auntie, and I have had lots of packings to
do in our lives? Why, we had to pack up <i>two</i> houses
when we came away from India, and that was much
much farther away than where we're going now!
And you were <i>such</i> a tiny baby then&mdash;it was very
much harder, for mother was very very sad, and she
never thought you would grow to be a big strong boy
like what you are now."</p>

<p>"Was that when&mdash;&mdash;" began thoughtless Denny,
but Fritz gave her a tug.</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> it makes mother unhappy to talk
about that time," he whispered; but mother heard
him.</p>

<p>"No, Fritz," she said; "I don't mind Denny
thinking about it. I am so glad to have all of you,
dears, happy and good, that my sorrow is not so bad
as it was. And I am so glad you and Celia can
remember your father. Poor Baby&mdash;<i>he</i> can't remember
him," she said, softly stroking Baby's face.</p>

<p>"'Cos he went to Heaven when him was so little,"
said Baby. Then he put his arms round mother's
neck. "Him and Fritz will soon grow big, and be
werry good to mother," he said. "And ganfather and
auntie are werry good to mother, isn't they?" he
added.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," said mother; "and to all of you too.
What would we do without grandfather and auntie?"</p>

<p>"Some poor little boys and girls has no mothers
and ganfathers, and no stockings and shoes, and no
<i>nothings</i>," said Baby solemnly.</p>

<p>"There's <i>some</i> things I shouldn't mind not having,"
said Fritz; "I shouldn't mind having no lessons."</p>

<p>"O Fritz," said his sisters; "what a lazy boy you
are!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm just <i>not</i> lazy. I'm awfully fond of doing
<i>everything</i>&mdash;I don't even mind if it's a hard thing, so
long as it isn't anything in books," said Fritz, sturdily.
"Some people's made one way, and some's made
another, and I'm made the way of not liking
books."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Baby will say to books," said
mother, smiling.</p>

<p>"Is jography in books," said Baby. "Him wants
to learn jography."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think it's awfully stupid," said Denny. "I'm
sure you won't like it once you begin. Did <i>you</i> like
lessons when you were little, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure mother did," said Fritz. "People's
fathers and mothers were always far gooder than their
children are. I've noticed that. If ever big people
tell you about when they were little, it's always about
how good they were. And they say always, 'Dear
me, how happy children should be nowadays; <i>we</i>
were never allowed to do so and so when <i>we</i> were
little.' That's the way old Mrs. Nesbitt always talks,
isn't it mother? I wonder if it's true. If people
keep getting naughtier than their fathers and mothers
were, the world will get <i>very</i> naughty some day. <i>Is</i>
it true?"</p>

<p>"I think it's true that children get to be more
spoilt," said Denny in a low voice. "Just look how
Baby's clambering all over mother! O Baby, you
nearly knocked over mother's cup! <i>I</i> never was
allowed to do like that when <i>I</i> was a little girl."</p>

<p>Everybody burst out laughing&mdash;even mother&mdash;but
Denny had the good quality of not minding being
laughed at.</p>

<p>"Was the tea nice, and the bread and butter and
honey?" she said eagerly, as mother rose to put the
empty cup in a place of safety.</p>

<p>"Very nice, thank you," said mother. "But I
must go, dears. I have a good many things to talk
about with grandfather and auntie."</p>

<p>"Packing?" said Baby.</p>

<p>"How you do go on about packing!" said Denny.
"Of course mother's not going to pack to-night."</p>

<p>Baby's face fell.</p>

<p>"Him does so want to begin packing," he said
dolefully. "'Appose we forgottened somesing, and
we was over the sea!"</p>

<p>"Well, I must talk about it all, and write down
all we have to take," said mother. "So I must go to
auntie now."</p>

<p>"Oh, not yet, not yet. Just five minutes more!"
cried the children. "And, mother," said Celia, "you've
not answered my question. <i>Is</i> it true that children
used to be so much better long ago? Were you
never naughty?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said mother, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" said Celia. "Often, mother?
I do hope you were often naughty. Do tell us a
story about something naughty you did when you
were little. You know it would be a good lesson
for us. It would show us how awfully good one
may learn to be, for, you know, you're awfully good
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you are," said Fritz and Denny.</p>

<p>"Mother's <i>dedfully</i> good," said Baby, poking up
his face from her knee where he had again perched
himself, to kiss her. "Do tell him one story of when
you was a little girl, mother."</p>

<p>Mother's face seemed for a minute rather puzzled.
Then it suddenly cleared up.</p>

<p>"I will tell you a very little story," she said; "it
really is a very little story, but it is as long as I have
time for just now, and it may amuse you. Baby's
packing put it in my head."</p>

<p>"Is it about when you were a little girl, mother?"
interrupted Denny.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, when I was a little girl, I had no
mother."</p>

<p>The elder children nodded their heads. But Baby,
to whom it was a new idea, shook his sadly.</p>

<p>"Zat was a gate pity," he said. "Poor mother to
have no mother. Had you no shoes and stockings,
and nothing nice to eat?"</p>

<p>"You sill&mdash;&mdash;" began Denny, but mother stopped
her.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said, "I had shoes and stockings,
and everything I wanted, for I had a very kind father.
You know how kind grandfather is? And I had a
kind sister whom you know too. But when I was a
little girl, my sister was not herself <i>very</i> big, and she
had a great deal to do <i>for</i> a not very big girl, you
know. There were our brothers, for we had several,
and though they were generally away at school there
seemed always something to do for them&mdash;letters to
write to them, if there was nothing else&mdash;and then,
in the holidays, there were all their new shirts,
and stockings, and things to get to take back to
school. Helen seemed always busy. She had been
at school too, before your grandfather came back
from India, for five years, bringing me with him,
quite a wee little girl of four. And Helen was so
happy to be with us again, that she begged not
to go back to school, and, as she was really very
well on for her age, grandfather let her stay at
home."</p>

<p>"There, you see," whispered Celia, nudging Fritz.
"It's beginning&mdash;it always does&mdash;you hear how
awfully good auntie was."</p>

<p>Mother went on quietly. If she heard what Celia
said she took no notice. "Grandfather let her stay
at home and have lessons there. She had a great
many lessons to learn for her age besides those that
one learns out of books. She had to learn to be
very active, and very thoughtful, and, above all, very
patient. For the little sister she had to take care of
was, I am afraid, a very spoilt little girl when she
first came home. Grandfather had spoiled her without
meaning it; he was so sorry for her because she
had no mother, and Helen was so sorry for her too,
that it was rather difficult for her not to spoil her as
well."</p>

<p>Here Baby himself "inrumpted."</p>

<p>"Him doesn't understand," he said. "Who <i>were</i>
that little girl? Him wants a story about mother
when <i>her</i> was a little girl;" and the corners of his
mouth went down, and his eyes grew dewy-looking,
in a very sad way.</p>

<p>"Poor Baby," said mother. "I'll try and tell it
more plainly. <i>I</i> was that little girl, and auntie was
my sister Helen. I must get on with my little story.
I was forgetting that Baby would not quite understand.
Well, one day to my great delight, Helen told
me that grandfather was going to take her and me
and the two brothers, who were then at home, to
spend Christmas with one of our aunts in London.
This aunt had children too, and though I had never
seen them Helen told me they were very nice, for
she knew them well, as she used to go there for her
holidays before we came home. She told me most
about a little girl called Lilly, who was just about
my age. I had never had a little friend of my own
age, and I was always talking and thinking about
how nice it would be, and I was quite vexed with
Helen because she would not begin to pack up at
once. I was always teasing her to know what trunks
we should take, and if all my dolls might go, and I
am sure poor Helen often wished she had not told
me anything about it till the very day before. I
got in the way of going up to the big attic where the
trunks were kept, and of looking at them and wondering
which would go, and wishing Helen would let
me have one all for myself and my dolls and their
things. There was one trunk which took my fancy
more than all the others. It was an old-fashioned
trunk, but it must have been a very good one, for it
shut with a sort of spring, and inside it had several
divisions, some with little lids of their own, and I
used to think how nice it would be for me, I could
put all my dolls in so beautifully, and each would
have a kind of house for itself. I don't remember
how I managed to get it open, perhaps it had been a
little open when I first began my visits to the attic,
for the lid was very heavy, and I was neither big nor
strong for my age. But it <i>was</i> open, and it stayed
so, for no one else ever went up to the attic but I.
The other people in the house were too busy, and no
one would have thought there was anything amusing
in looking at empty trunks in a row. But I went up
to the attic day after day. I climbed up the narrow
staircase as soon as I had had my breakfast, and
stayed there till I heard my nurse calling me to get
ready to go out, or to come to my lessons, for I was
beginning to learn to read, and I used to have a little
lesson every day. And at last one day I said to my
sister,</p>

<p>"'Helen, may I have the big trunk with the little
cupboards in it for <i>my</i> trunk?'</p>

<p>"Helen was busy at the time, and I don't think
she heard exactly what I said. She answered me
hurriedly that she would see about it afterwards.
But I went on teasing.</p>

<p>"'May I begin putting Marietta and Lady Regina
into the little cupboards inside?' I said.</p>

<p>"'Oh yes, I daresay you can if you like,' said
Helen. She told me afterwards that when I spoke
of cupboards she never thought I meant a trunk, she
thought I was speaking of some of the nursery
cupboards.</p>

<p>"It was just bed-time then, too late for me to go
to the attic, for I knew there was no chance of my
getting leave to go up there with a candle. But I fell
asleep with my head full of how nicely I could put
the dolls into the trunk, each with her clothes beside
her, and the very first thing the next morning I got
them all together and I mounted up to the attic. I
had never told nurse about my going up there. Once
or twice, perhaps, she had seen me coming down the
stair, but very likely she had thought I had only
been a little way up to look out of a window there
was there. I don't know why I didn't tell her,
perhaps I was afraid of her stopping my going. I
waited till she was busy about her work, fetching
coals and so on, and then I trotted off with Lady
Regina under one arm and Marietta under the other,
and a bundle of their clothes tied up in my pinafore
before, to make my way upstairs to the delightful
trunk. It was open as usual, and after putting my
dolls and bundles down on the floor, I managed to
lift out the two top trays. One of them was much
larger than the other, and it was in what I called the
cupboards below the smaller one that I settled to put
Regina and Marietta. There were two of these little
cupboards, and each had a lid. They would just do
beautifully. Under the larger tray there was just one
big space without a lid, 'just a hole,' I called it. I
went on for a little time, laying in some of the clothes
first to make a nice soft place for the dolls to lie on,
but I soon got tired. It was so very far to reach
over, for the outside edges of the box were high,
higher of course than the <i>inside</i> divisions, for the
trays I had taken out, which lay on the top of the
lower spaces, were a good depth, and there had been
no division between them. It came into my head
that it would be much easier if I were to get into the
box myself&mdash;I could stand in the big hole, as I called
it, and reach over to the little divisions where I
wanted to put the dolls, and it would be far less tiring
than trying to reach over from the outside. So I
clambered in&mdash;it was not very difficult&mdash;and when I
found myself really inside the trunk I was so pleased
that I sat down cross-legged, like a little Turk, to
take a rest before going on with what I called my
packing. But sitting still for long was not in my
way&mdash;I soon jumped up again, meaning to reach over
for Lady Regina, who was lying on the floor beside
the trunk, but, how it happened I cannot tell, I suppose
I somehow caught the tapes which fastened the
lid; any way down it came! It did not hurt me
much, for I had not had time to stretch out my head,
and the weight fell mostly on my shoulders, sideways
as it were, and before I knew what had happened I
found myself doubled up somehow in my hole, with
the heavy lid on the top of me, all in the dark, except
a little line of light round the edge, for the lid had not
shut quite down; the hasp of the lock&mdash;as the little
sticking-out piece is called&mdash;had caught in the fall,
and was wedged into a wrong place. So, luckily for
me, there was still a space for some air to come in,
and a little light, though very little. I was dreadfully
frightened at first; then I began to get over my fright
a little, and to struggle to get out. Of course my
first idea was to try to push up the lid with my head
and shoulders; I remember the feeling of it pushing
back upon me&mdash;the dreadful feeling that I couldn't
move it, that I was shut up there and couldn't get
out! I was too little to understand all at once that
there could be any danger, that I might perhaps be
suffocated&mdash;that means choked, Baby&mdash;for want of
air; or that I might really be hurt by being so cramped
and doubled up. And really there was not much
danger; if I had been older I should have been more
frightened than there was really any reason to be.
But I was big enough to begin very quickly to get
very angry and impatient. I had never in all my life
been forced to do anything I disliked; often and often
my nurse, and sometimes Helen, had begged me to
try to sit still for a minute or two, but I never would.
And now the lesson of having to give in to something
much worse than sitting still in my nice little chair
by the nursery fire, or standing still for two minutes
while a new frock was tried on, had to be learnt!
There was no getting rid of it; I kicked and I
pushed, it was no use; the strong heavy lid which
had been to India and back two or three times would
not move the least bit. I tried to poke out my fingers
through the little space that was left, but I could not
find the lock, and it was a good thing I did not, for if
I had touched the hasp, most likely the lid would
have fallen quite into its place, crushing my poor
little fingers, and shutting me in without any air at
all. At last I thought of another plan. I set to
work screaming.</p>

<p>"'Nurse, nurse, Nelly, oh Nelly,' I cried, and at
last I shouted, 'Papa, <i>Papa</i>, <span class="smallcaps">Papa</span>,' at the top of my
voice. But it was no use! Most children would
have begun screaming at the very first. But I was
not a <i>frightened</i> child, and I was very proud. I did
not want any one to find me shut up in a box like
that, besides, they would be sure to stop my ever
coming up to the attic again. So it was not till I
had tired myself out with trying to push up the lid
that I set to work to screaming, and that made it all
the more provoking that my calls brought no one.
At last I got so out of patience that I set to work
again kicking for no use at all, but just because I
was so angry. I kicked and screamed, and at last I
burst into tears and <i>roared</i>. Then I caught sight,
through the chink, of Lady Regina's blue dress,
where the doll was lying on the floor near the
trunk.</p>

<p>"'Nasty Regina,' I shouted, 'nasty, ugly Regina.
You are lying there as if there was nothing the
matter, and it was all for you I came up here. I
hate dolls&mdash;they never do nothing. If you were a
little dog you'd go and bark, and then somebody
would come and let me out.'</p>

<p>"Then I went on crying and sobbing till I was
perfectly tired, and then what do you think I did?
Though I was so uncomfortable, all crushed up into
a little ball, I went to sleep! I went to sleep as
soundly as if I had been in my own little bed, and
afterwards I found, from what they told me, that I
must have slept quite two hours. When I woke up
I could not think where I was. I felt so stiff and
sore, and when I tried to stretch myself out I could
not, and then I remembered where I was! It seemed
quite dark; I wondered if it was night, till I noticed
the little chink of light at the edge of the lid, and
then I began to cry again, but not so wildly as before.
All of a sudden I thought I heard a sound&mdash;some
one was coming upstairs! and then I heard voices.</p>

<p>"'Fallen out of the window,' one said. 'Oh no,
nurse, she <i>couldn't</i>! She could never get through.'</p>

<p>"But yet the person seemed to be looking out of
the window all the same, for I heard them opening
and shutting it. And then I called out again.</p>

<p>"'Oh Nelly, Nelly. I'se here; I'se shut up in
the big box with the cupboards.'</p>

<p>"They didn't hear me at first. My little voice
must have sounded very faint and squeaky from out
of the trunk, besides they were not half-way up the
attic-stairs. So I went on crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Oh Nelly, Nelly! I'se up here. Oh Nelly,
Nelly!'</p>

<p>"She heard me this time. Dear Nelly! I never
have called to her in vain, children, in all my life.
And in half a minute she had dashed up the stairs,
and, guided by my voice, was kneeling down beside
the trunk.</p>

<p>"'Little May, my poor little May,' Nelly called
out; and do you know I really think she was crying
too! I was&mdash;by the time Nelly and the servants
who were with her had got the lid unhooked and
raised, and had lifted me out&mdash;I was in floods of
tears. I clung to Nelly, and told her how 'dedful'
it had been, and she petted me so that I am afraid I
quite forgot it was all my own fault.</p>

<p>"'You might have been there for hours and
hours, May,' Nelly said to me, 'if it hadn't been for
nurse thinking of the window on the stair. You
must never go off by yourself to do things like that,'
and when I told her that I had asked her and she
had given me leave, she said she had not at all
known what I meant, and that I must try to remember
not to tease about things once I had been told to
wait. Any way I think I had got a good lesson of
patience that day, and one that I never forgot, for it
really is not at all a pleasant thing to be shut up in
a big trunk."</p>

<p>Mother stopped.</p>

<p>Baby, who had been listening with solemn eyes,
said slowly,</p>

<p>"Him will not pack by hisself. Him will wait
till somebody can help him. It would be so dedful
sad if him was to get shuttened up like poor little
mother, and perhaps you'd all go away ac'oss the sea
and nebber find him."</p>

<p>The corners of his mouth went down at this
sorrowful picture, and his eyes looked as if they were
beginning to think about crying. But mother and
Celia set to work petting and kissing him before the
tears had time to come.</p>

<p>"As if we would ever go across the sea without
<i>him</i>," said mother.</p>

<p>"Why, we should never know how to do <i>anything</i>
without Herr Baby," said Celia.</p>

<p>"Fritz and Baby will do all the fussy things in
travelling&mdash;taking the tickets, and counting the
luggage, and all that&mdash;they're such big men, aren't
they?" said Denny, with mischief in her twinkling
green eyes.</p>

<p>"Now you, just mind what you're about," said
Fritz, gallantly. "You'll make him cry just when
mother's been comforting him up. Such stupids
girls are!" he added in a lower voice.</p>

<p>"I really must go now," said mother, getting up
from her chair. "Auntie will not know what has
become of me. I have been up here, why a whole
half hour, instead of five minutes!"</p>

<p>"Auntie will think mother's got shut up in a
trunk again," said Denny, whose tongue <i>never</i> could
be still for long, and at this piece of wit they all
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>All but Herr Baby. He couldn't see that it was
any laughing matter. Mother's story had sunk deep
into his mind. Trunks were things to be careful of.
Baby saw this clearly.</p>

</div>

<p>He woke early next morning. He had so much to
think of, you see. So much that even his dreams
were full of all he had heard yesterday.</p>

<p>"Him's been d'eaming him was in the big, big,
'normous boat, and zen him d'eamed of being
shuttened up in a t'unk like <i>poor</i> little mother," he
confided to Denny.</p>

<p>He was forced to tell Denny a good many things,
because they slept in the same room, and, of course,
everybody knows that <i>whatever</i> mammas and nurses
say, going-to-sleep-in-bed time is <i>the</i> time for talking.
Waking-up-in-the-morning time is rather tempting,
too, particularly in summer, when the sun comes in
at the windows <i>so</i> brightly and the birds are <i>so</i> lively,
chattering away to each other, and all the world is up
and about, except "<i>us</i>," who <i>have</i> to stay in bed till
seven o'clock! Ah, it <i>is</i> a trial! On the whole, I
don't think chattering in the mornings is so much to
be found fault with as chattering at night. It is
only children who are so silly as to keep themselves
awake when the time for going to sleep has come.
The birds and the bees, and the little lambs even, all
know when that time has come, and go to sleep without
any worry to themselves or other people. But
children are not always so sensible. I <i>could</i> tell you
a story&mdash;only I am afraid if she were to read it in
this little book it would make her feel so ashamed
that I should really be sorry for her, so I will not
tell you her name nor where she lives&mdash;of a little
girl who was promised two pounds, two whole gold
pounds&mdash;fancy! if for one month she would go
quietly to sleep at night when she was put to bed,
and let her sister do the same; and she was to lose
two shillings every night she forgot or disobeyed.
Well, what do you think? at the end of two weeks
the two pounds had come down already to nineteen
shillings! She had forgotten already ten times, or
ten and a half times&mdash;I don't quite understand how
it had come to nineteen, but so it had; and at the
end of the month&mdash;no I don't think I will tell you
what it had come down to. Only this will show you
how much more difficult it is to get out of a bad
habit than to get into a good one, for this little girl
is very sweet and good in many ways, and I love her
dearly&mdash;<i>only</i> she had got into this bad habit, and it
was stronger, as bad habits so often are, than her real
true wish to do what her mother told her.</p>

<p>But I have wandered away from Herr Baby, and
I am afraid you won't be pleased. He was forced, I
was saying, to tell Denny a good many things, because
he was most with her. I don't think he would
have told her as much but for that, for Denny's head
was a very flighty one, and she never cared to think
or talk about the same thing for long together, which
was not <i>at all</i> Herr Baby's way. <i>He</i> liked to think
a good deal about everything, and one thing lasted
him a good while.</p>

<p>"Him's been d'eaming such a lot," he said to
Denny this morning.</p>

<p>"I think dreams are very stupid," said Denny.
"What's the good of them? If they made things
come <i>real</i> they would be some good. Like, you know,
if I was to dream somebody gave me something
awfully nice, and then when I woke up I was to see
the thing on my bed, <i>then</i> dreams would be some
good."</p>

<p>"But if zou d'eamed somesing dedful, like being
shuttened up in a t'unk like <i>poor</i> little mother, <i>zen</i> it
wouldn't be nice for it to come zeal," said Baby, who
never forgot to look at things from both sides.</p>

<p>"No, of course it wouldn't. How stupid you are!"
said Denny. "And how your head does run on one
thing. I'm quite tired of you talking about mother
being shut up in the trunk. Do talk of something
else."</p>

<p>"Him can't talk of somesing else when him's
sinking of one sing," said Baby gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, then don't talk at all," said Denny sharply,
"and indeed I think we'd better be quiet, or Lisa
will be coming in, and scolding us. It's only half-past
six."</p>

<p>Baby did not speak for a minute or two. Then he
said solemnly,</p>

<p>"When us goes away ac'oss the sea in the 'normous
boat, him <i>hopes</i> him won't sleep in the same zoom as
you any more."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope not," said Denny snappishly.
There was some excuse for her this morning, she was
really rather sleepy, and it is very tiresome to be
wakened up at half-past six, when one is quite inclined
to sleep till half-past seven.</p>

<p>But Baby could not go to sleep again. His mind
was still running on packing. If he could but have
a <i>little</i> box of his own to pack his own treasures in,
then he would be sure none would be forgotten. He
did not want a <i>big</i> trunk&mdash;not one in which he could
be shuttened up like mother, but just a nice little one.
If mother would give him one! Stay&mdash;where had he
seen one, just what he wanted, was it in the nursery
or in the cupboard where Fritz kept his garden-tools
and his skates, and all the big boy things which Baby
too hoped to have of his own some day? No, it was
not there. It must have been&mdash;yes, it was in the
pantry when he went to ask James for a glass of water.
Up on a shelf, high up it stood, "a tiny <i>sweet</i> little
t'unk," said Herr Baby to himself, "wouldn't mother
let him have it?" He would ask her this morning as
soon as he saw her. Then he lay still and thought
over to himself all the things he would pack in the
tiny sweet little t'unk; his best Bible with his name</p>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="ind1">"Raymond Arthur Aylmer,"</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">in the gold letters on the back, should have the nicest
corner, of course, and his "<i>scented</i> purse," as he called
the Russia leather purse which grandfather had given
him on his last birthday, that would go nicely beside
the Bible, and his watch that <i>really</i> ticked as long as
you turned the key in it&mdash;all those things would fit
in, nicely packed in "totton wool," of course, and
crushy paper. The thought of it all made Baby's
fingers fidget with eagerness to begin his packing.
If only mother would give him the box! It must be
mother's, for if it was James's he would keep it in his
own room instead of up on the pantry shelf among
all the glasses and cups. If Baby could just see it
again he would know 'ezackly if it would do!</p>

<p>Baby looked about him. Everything was perfectly
still, he heard no one moving about the house&mdash;Denny
had said it was only half-past six.</p>

<p>"Denny," said Baby softly.</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"<i>Denny</i>," a very little louder.</p>

<p>Still no reply; but Baby, by leaning over the edge
of his cot a little, could see that Denny's eyes were
shut, and her nose was half buried in the pillow in
the way she always turned it when she went to sleep.
Denny had gone to sleep again.</p>

<p>"Zes," said Herr Baby to himself; "her's a'leep&mdash;her's
beazing so soft."</p>

<p>He looked about him again; he stuck one little
warm white foot out of bed&mdash;it did feel <i>rather</i> cold;
he felt more than half inclined just to cuddle himself
up warm again and lie still till Lisa came to dress
him. But the thought of the little t'unk was too
much for him.</p>

<p>"Him would so like just to <i>see</i> it," he said to
himself.</p>

<p>Then he stood right up in bed and clambered over
the edge of the cot the way he had to do to get out
of it by himself. He did not make much noise&mdash;not
enough to waken Denny, and indeed he would not
much have minded if she <i>had</i> awakened, only that
perhaps she would have wanted to go too, and Baby
wished just to go down to the pantry this quiet time
of the morning before any one was there and take a
good look by himself.</p>

<p>It was cold on the stair&mdash;just at the edge, that is
to say, where the carpet did not cover, and where
he had stepped without thinking, not being used to
trotting about on bare feet, you see. But in the
middle, on the carpet, it was nice and soft and warm.</p>

<p>"It would be dedful to be poor boys wif no shoes
and stockings," he said to himself, "'cept on the
carpet. Him would like to buy lots of lubly soft
carpets for zem poor boys."</p>

<p>And he pitied the poor boys still more when he
got to the back passage leading to the pantry, where
there was no carpet at all, only oilcloth. He pattered
along as fast as he could; there was no sound to be
heard but the ticking of the clock, and Baby wondered
that he had never noticed before what a loud
ticking clock it was; it did not come into his head
that it was very late for none of the servants to be
down, for such matters were not his concern, and if
he had known the truth that Denny had made a
mistake of an hour, and that it was only half-past five
instead of half-past six, he would not have thought
much about it.</p>

<p>He got to the pantry at last. It was darker in
here than in the passage outside, which was a disappointment.
The shutters were shut, that was the
reason, and when Baby looked up at them and saw
how strong and barred they were, even <i>he</i> felt that it
would be no use to try to open them. He climbed
up on to the dresser that ran round one side of the
wall to see better. Yes, there it was&mdash;the tiny, sweet,
little t'unk&mdash;just as he had been fancying it. Not so
very high up either. If he could but give it a little
poke out he could almost reach it down&mdash;it could not
be heavy, it was <i>such</i> a tiny t'unk; and, oh, if he
could carry it out to the passage, where it was light,
how beautifully he could look at it! He stood up on
tiptoe, and found he could almost reach it. A brush
with a sticking-out handle was lying beside him.
Baby took it, and found that by poking it in a little
behind the box he could make it move out, and if it
were moved out a very little way he could reach to lift
it down. He moved it out enough, then he stretched
up his two hands to lift it down&mdash;it was not very
heavy, but still rather heavier than he had thought.
But with the help of his curly head, which he partly
rested it on, he got it out safely enough, and was just
slipping it gently downwards to the dresser when
<i>somehow</i> the brush handle, which he had left on the
shelf, caught him or the box, he could not tell which,
and, startled by the feeling of something pushing
against him, Baby lost his balance and fell! Off the
dresser right down on to the hard floor, which had no
carpet even to make it softer, he tumbled, and the
little t'unk on the top of him. What a noise it made&mdash;even
in the middle of his fright Baby could not
help thinking what a tremendous noise he and the
box seemed to make. He lay still for a minute;
luckily the box, though it had come straight after
him, had fallen a little to one side, and had not hit
him. He was bruised enough by the floor already&mdash;any
more bumps would have been <i>too</i> much, would
they not? But the poor box itself was to be pitied;
it had come open in the fall, and all that was in it had
naturally tumbled out. <i>That</i> explained the noise and
clatter. The box had held&mdash;indeed it had been made
on purpose to hold them&mdash;two beautiful glass jugs,
which had been sent to mother all the way from Italy!
Baby had never seen them, because they were only
used when mother and auntie wanted the dinner-table
to look very nice, and of course Baby was too little
ever to come down to dinner. And, alas, the beautiful
jugs, so fine and thin that one could almost have
thought the fairies had made them, were both broken,
one of them, indeed, crushed and shivered into mere
bits of glass lying about the pantry floor, and the box
itself had lost its lid, for the hinges had been broken,
too, in the fall.</p>

<p>For a minute or two Baby could not make out
what had happened. He felt a little stupid with the
fall, and sore too. But he never was ready to cry for
bumps or knocks; he would cry much more quickly
if any one spoke sharply to him than if he hurt himself.
So at first he lay still, wondering what was the
matter. Then he sat up and looked about him, and
<i>then</i>, seeing the broken box and the broken glass, he
understood that he had done some harm, and he burst
into piteous sobbing.</p>

<p>"Him didn't mean," he cried; "him didn't know
there was nuffin in the tiny t'unk. Oh, what shall
him do?"</p>

<p>He cried and sobbed, and, being now very frightened,
he cried the more when he saw that there was blood
on his little white nightgown, and that the blood
came from one of his little cold feet, which had been cut
by a piece of the broken glass. Baby was much more
frightened by the sight of blood than by anything else&mdash;when
he climbed up on the nursery chest of drawers,
and Denny told him he'd be killed if he fell down, he
didn't mind a bit, but when Lisa said that he might hurt
his face if he fell, and make it <i>bleed</i>, he came down at
once&mdash;and now the sight of the blood was too much.</p>

<p>"Oh, him's hurt hisself, him's all bleeding!" he
cried. "Oh, <i>what</i> shall him do?"</p>

<p>He dared not move, for he was afraid of lifting the
cut foot&mdash;he really did not know what to do&mdash;when
he heard steps coming along the passage, pattering
steps something like his own, and before he had time
to think who it could be, a second little white-night-gowned
figure trotted into the room.</p>

<p>"Baby, poor Baby, what's the matter?" and, looking
up, Baby saw it was Fritz.</p>

<p>"Him's hurt hisself, him's tumbled, and the tiny
t'unk is brokened, and somesing else is brokened.
Him didn't mean," he sobbed; and Fritz sat down on
the floor beside him, having the good sense to keep
out of the way of the broken glass, and lifted the
little bleeding foot gently.</p>

<p>"Must have some sticking-plaster," said Fritz.
"There's some in mother's pocket-book in her room.
We must go to mother, Baby."</p>

<p>"But him can't walk," said Baby piteously.
"Him's foot bleedens dedful when him moves it."</p>

<p>"Then I must carry you," said Fritz, importantly.</p>

<p>With some difficulty he got Baby on to his back
and set off with him. Baby had often ridden on
Fritz's back before, in the nursery, for fun, and it
seemed very nice and easy. But now, though he had
only his nightgown on, Fritz was surprised to find
how heavy he seemed after going a little way. He
was obliged to rest after he had gone up a few steps,
and Baby began to cry worse than before when he
saw how tired poor Fritz was. I really don't know
how they ever got to the door of mother's room, and,
when their knocking brought her out, it was rather a
frightening sight for her&mdash;Baby perched on Fritz's
back, both little boys looking white and miserable,
and the wounded foot covered with blood.</p>

<p>But mother knew better than to ask what was the
matter till she had done something to put things to
rights again.</p>

<p>"Him's foot" was the first thing Baby said,
stretching out his poor little toes.</p>

<p>And the foot looked so bad that mother felt quite
thankful when she had bathed it and found that the
cut was not really a very deep one after all. And
when it was nicely plastered up, and both little boys
were tucked into mother's bed to get warm again, then
mother had to hear all about it. It was not much
Fritz could tell. He, too, had wakened early, and
had heard Denny and Baby talking, for he slept in a
little room near theirs. He had fallen half asleep
again, and started up, fancying he heard a noise and
a cry, and, getting out of bed, had found his way to the
pantry, guided by Baby's sobs. But what Baby was
doing in the pantry, or why he had wandered off there
all alone so early in the morning, Fritz did not know.</p>

<p>So Baby had to tell his own story, which he did
straight on in his own way. He never thought of <i>not</i>
telling it straight on; he was afraid mother would be
sorry when she heard about the "somesing" that was
broken, but it had never entered his little head that
one could help telling mother "ezackly" all about
anything. And so he told the whole&mdash;how he had
been "sinking" about trunks and packing, and
"d'eaming" about them too, how Denny had been
"razer c'oss" and wouldn't talk, and how the thought
of the tiny sweet t'unk had come into his head all of
itself, and he had fancied how nice it would be to go
downstairs and look at it on the pantry shelf, and
then how all the misfortunes had come. At the end
he burst into tears again when he had to tell of the
"somesing brokened," now lying about in shiny fragments
on the pantry floor.</p>

<p>Poor mother! She knew in a minute what it was
that was broken, and I cannot say but that she was
very sorry, more sorry perhaps than Baby could
understand, for she had had the pretty jugs many
years, and the thoughts of happy days were mingled
with the shining of the rainbow glass. Baby saw the
sorry look on her face, and stretched up his two arms
to clasp her neck.</p>

<p>"Him is so sorry, so werry sorry," he said. "Him
will take all the money of him's money-box to buy
more shiny jugs for mother."</p>

<p>Mother kissed him, but told him that could not be.</p>

<p>"The jugs came from a far-away country, Baby
dear," she said, "and you could not get them here.
Besides, I cared for them in a way you can't understand.
I had had them a long time, and one gets to
care for things, even if they are not very pretty in
themselves, when one has had them so long."</p>

<p>"Oh ses, him does understand," said Baby. "Him
cares for old 'sings, far best."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fritz, "he really does, mother. He
cries when Lisa says she must put away his old
shoes, and his old woolly lamb is dreadful&mdash;really
dreadful, but he <i>won't</i> give it away."</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> such a sweet face," said Baby.</p>

<p>"Well I don't care; I wish it was burnt up. He
mustn't take it in the railway with us when we go
away; must he, mother?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't it be washed?" said mother.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, and I don't believe Baby would
like it as much if it was. Would you, Baby?" said
Fritz.</p>

<p>Baby would not answer directly. He seemed
rather in a hurry to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "when we go away in the
'normous boat, won't we p'raps go to the country
where the shiny jugs is made? And if him takes all
the money in him's money-box, couldn't him buy
some for you?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be the same ones," said Fritz.</p>

<p>Baby's face fell. Mother tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the jugs any more just now,"
she said. "Some day, perhaps, when you are a big
man you will get me some others quite as pretty, that
I shall like for your sake. What will please me more
than new jugs just now, Baby, is for you to promise
me not to try to do things like that without telling
any one. Just think how very badly hurt you might
have been. If only you had waited to ask me about
the little box all would have been right, and my
pretty jugs would not have been broken."</p>

<p>"And mother told us that last night, you know,
dear," said Fritz, in his proper big brother tone.
"Don't you remember in the story about her when
she was little? It all came of her not waiting for
her big sister to see about the trunk."</p>

<p>Baby gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"If God hadn't put so much 'sinking into him's
head, it would have been much better," he said.
"Him 'sinks and 'sinks, and zen him can't help wanting
to do 'sings zat moment minute."</p>

<p>"Then 'him' must learn what <i>patience</i> means,"
said mother with a little smile. "But I'll tell you
what <i>I've</i> been thinking&mdash;that if we don't take care
somebody else may be hurting themselves with the
broken glass on the pantry floor."</p>

<p>"P'raps the cat," said Baby, starting up, "oh
<i>poor</i> pussy, if her was to cut her dear little foots.
Shall him go downstairs again, mother, to shut the
door? Why, him's foot's still <i>zather</i> bleedy," he
added, drawing out the wounded foot, which had a
handkerchief wrapped round it above the plaster.</p>

<p>"No," said his mother, "it will be better for me
to tell the servants myself," so she rang the bell, and
as it was now about the time that Denny had thought
it when Baby first woke up, in a few minutes her
maid appeared, looking rather astonished. She looked
still more astonished, and a little afraid too, when
she caught sight of the two curly heads, one dark
and one light, on mother's pillow.</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong with the young gentlemen?"
she said. "Shall I call Lisa, my lady?"</p>

<p>"No, not quite yet," said mother. "I rang to
tell you to warn James and the others that there is
some broken glass on the pantry floor, and they must
be careful not to tread on it, and it must be swept up."</p>

<p>"Broken glass, ma'am," repeated the maid, who
was rather what Denny called "'quisitive." "Was
it the cat? I did think I heard a noise early this
morning."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't the cat," said mother. "It was an
accident. James will see what is broken."</p>

<p>The light curly head had disappeared by this time
under the clothes, for Baby had ducked out of sight,
feeling ashamed of its being known that <i>he</i> had been
the cat. But as soon as the maid had left the room
he came up again to the surface like a little fish, and
a warm feeling of thanks to his mother went through
his heart.</p>

<p>"You won't tell the servants it were him, will
you?" he whispered, stretching up for another kiss.</p>

<p>"No, not if 'him' promises never to try to do
things like reaching down boxes for himself. Herr
Baby must ask mother about things like that, mustn't
he?" she said.</p>

<p>Mother often called him "Herr Baby" for fun.
The name had taken her fancy when he was a very
tiny child, and Lisa had first come to be his nurse.
For Lisa was <i>very</i> polite; she would not have
thought it at all proper to call him "Baby" all by
itself.</p>

<p>Herr Baby kissed mother a third time, which, as
he was not a very kissing person, was a great deal in
one morning.</p>

<p>"Ses," he said, "him will always aks mother.
Mother is so sweet," he added coaxingly.</p>

<p>"He calls everything he likes 'sweet,'" said
Fritz. "Mother and the cat and the tiny trunk&mdash;they're
all sweet.'"</p>

<p>But mother smiled, so Baby didn't mind.</p>

<p>How, I can't tell, but, after all, <i>some</i>how the packing
got done, and everything was ready. They left a <i>few</i>
things behind that Herr Baby would certainly have
taken had he had the settling of it. They didn't take
the horses, <i>nor</i> the fireplaces, and, of course, as the
horses weren't to go, Thomas and Jones had to be left
behind too to take care of them, which troubled Baby
a good deal. And no doubt Thomas and Jones would
have been <i>very</i> unhappy if it hadn't been for the nice
way Baby spoke to them about coming back soon, and
the letters he would send them on their birthdays, and
that he would never like any other Thomases and
Joneses as much as them. It was really quite nice
to hear him, and Jones had to turn his head away
a little&mdash;Baby was afraid it was to hide that he was
crying.</p>

<p>It was a very busy time, and Baby was the busiest
of any. There was so much to think of. The rabbits
too had to be left behind, which was very sad, for one
couldn't write letters to <i>them</i> on their birthdays;
neither Denny, whom he asked about it, nor Baby
himself, could tell when the rabbits' birthdays were,
and besides, as Baby said, "what would be the good
of writing them letters if they couldn't read them?"
The only thing to do was to get the little girl at the
lodge to <i>promise</i> to take them fresh cabbages every
morning&mdash;that was one of the things Herr Baby had
to see about, himself. Lisa lost him one morning,
and found him at the lodge, after a great hunt, talking
very gravely to the little girl about it.</p>

<p>"Zou will p'omise, Betsy, p'omise certain sure,
<i>nebber</i> to forget," he was saying, and poor Betsy looked
quite frightened, Herr Baby was so very solemn.
Fritz wanted to make her kiss her mother's old Testament,
the way he had seen men do sometimes in his
grandfather's study when they came to tell about
things, and to promise they would speak the truth;
but Betsy, though she was ready enough to <i>promise</i>,
didn't like the other idea at all. She might be had
up to the court for such like doings, she said, and as
neither Fritz nor Baby had any idea what sort of place
the court was, though they fancied it was some kind
of prison for people who didn't keep their word, they
thought it better to leave it.</p>

<p>The "calanies" and the "Bully" were to go, that
was a comfort, and Peepy-Snoozle and Tim, the two
dormice, also, another comfort. Baby's own packing
was a serious matter, but, on the whole, I think
mother and Lisa and everybody were rather glad he
had it to do, as it gave other people a chance of getting
<i>theirs</i> done without the little feet pattering along
the passage or up the stairs, and the little shrill voice
asking what was going to be put into <i>this</i> trunk or
into <i>that</i> carpet-bag. He gave up thinking so much
about the other packing after a while, for he found
his own took all his time and attention. Mother had
found him a box after all. Not <i>the</i> box of course&mdash;that
was left empty, by Baby's wish, till some day
when he was a big man, he should go to the country
of the fairy glass and buy mother some new jugs&mdash;but
a very nice little box, and she gave him cotton
wool and crushy paper too, and everything was as
neat as possible, and the box quite packed and ready,
the first evening. But it was very queer that <i>every</i>
day after that Herr Baby found something or other
he had forgotten, or something that Denny and he
decided in their early morning talks, that it would be
silly to take. Or else it came into his head in the
night that his best Bible would be better in the <i>other</i>
corner, and the scenty purse on the top of it instead
of at one side. Any way it always happened that the
box had to be unpacked and packed again, and the
very last evening there was Herr Baby on his knees
before it on the floor, giving the finishing touches,
long after he should have been in bed.</p>

<p>"And we have to be up so early to-morrow morning,"
said mother, "my dear little boy, you really
<i>should</i> have been fast asleep by this time."</p>

<p>"And he wakes me <i>so</i> early in the morning," said
Denny, who was standing before the fire giving herself
little cross shakes every time poor Lisa, who was
combing out her long fair hair, came to a tuggy bit.
"<i>Lisa</i>, you're <i>hurting</i> me; <i>Lisa</i>, do take care," she
added snappishly.</p>

<p>"My dear Denny, how very impatient you are!"
said her mother. "I don't know how you will bear
all the little discomforts of a long journey if you can't
bear to have your hair combed."</p>

<p>On this, Denny, as Fritz would have said, "shut
up." She could not bear it to be thought that she
was babyish or "silly." Her great, great wish was to
be considered quite a big girl. You could get her to
do anything by telling her it would be babyish not to
do it, or that doing it would be like big people, which,
of course, showed that she <i>was</i> rather babyish in
reality, as sensible children understand that they
cannot be like big people in everything, and that
they wouldn't be at all nice if they were.</p>

<p>Baby always felt sorry for Denny or any of them
when mother found fault with them. He jumped up
from the floor&mdash;at least he <i>got</i> up, his legs were too
short for him to spring either up or down very
actively&mdash;and trotted across to his sister.</p>

<p>"Poor Denny," he said, reaching up to kiss her,
"him won't wake her up so early to-mollow morning."</p>

<p>"But we'll <i>have</i> to wake early to-morrow," said
Denny, rather crossly still, "it's no use you beginning
good ways about not waking me now, just when
everything's changed."</p>

<p>Baby looked rather sad.</p>

<p>"Is your box quite ready now, dear?" said his
mother. "Well then, let Lisa get you ready for bed
as quick as she can, and you and Denny must go to
sleep without any talking, and wake fresh in the
morning."</p>

<p>But Baby still looked sad; his face began working
and twisting, and at last he ran to mother and
hid it in her lap, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Denny makes him so unhappy," he said. "Him
doesn't like everysing to be changed like Denny says.
Him is so sorry to go away and to leave him's house
and Thomas and Jones, and oh! him is <i>so</i> sorry to
leave the labbits!"</p>

<p>"And him's a tired little boy. I think it's
because he's so tired that he's so sad about going
away," said mother. "Think, dear, how nice it is
that we're all going <i>together</i>, not Celia or Fritz or
anybody left behind. For you know Thomas has his
old mother he wouldn't like to leave, and Jones has
his wife and children. And if the rabbits could
talk, I'm quite sure they would tell you that they'd
far rather stay here in their own nice little house,
with plenty of cabbages, than be bundled into a box
and taken away in the railway ever so far, without
being able to run about for ever so many days."</p>

<p>Baby's face cleared a little.</p>

<p>"Betsy has p'omised," he said to himself. Then
he added, "<i>Him</i> won't like the railway neither if it's
like that."</p>

<p>"But <i>him's</i> not going to be put in a box or a
basket," said mother, laughing. "Him will have a
nice little corner all to himself in a cushioned railway
carriage, only just now he really <i>must</i> go to bed."</p>

<p>So she kissed him for good-night, and Denny too,
who, by this time, had recovered her good-humour in
the interest of listening to the conversation between
her mother and Herr Baby, and soon both little sister
and brother were fast asleep in their cots, dreaming
about the journey before them I daresay, or perhaps
forgetting all about it in the much queerer and
stranger journeys that small people are apt to fly
away upon at night, when their tired little bodies
<i>seem</i> to be lying quite still and motionless in bed.</p>

<p>It was strange enough&mdash;<i>almost</i> as strange as a
dream&mdash;the next morning when, long before it was
light, they had all to get up and be dressed at once
in their going-out things&mdash;that is to say their thick
boots and gaiters, and woollen under-jackets (for it
was very cold, though not yet far on in November),
while their ulsters and comforters and caps, and the
girls' sealskin coats and muffs and hats, were all
laid out in four little heaps by Lisa, so that they
should be ready to put on the moment breakfast was
over.</p>

<p>What a funny breakfast! Candles on the table,
for it was not, of course, worth while to light the
lamp, and everything looking more like a sort of
"muddley tea," Fritz said, than their usual trim
nursery breakfast.</p>

<p>"I can't eat," said Fritz, throwing down his bread
and butter; "it's no use."</p>

<p>"And there's eggs!" said Denny, who was comfortably
at work at hers, looking across at Fritz as if
it wouldn't be very difficult to eat up his egg too. "I
think it's very kind of cook to have got up so early
and made us eggs 'cos we were going away, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twasn't cook, 'twas Abigail," said Fritz. "I
saw her coming up with the eggs all in a pan with
hot water, so that they shouldn't get cold, she said to
Lisa."</p>

<p>"Well then it was very kind of Abigail, and&mdash;&mdash;"
said Denny.</p>

<p>"'Twasn't Abigail that made the eggs," said Baby,
"'twas the hens zat laid them. Denny should say
the <i>hens</i> was werry kind."</p>

<p>"Oh bother," said Denny, "I wish you'd not
interrupt me. I don't care who it was. I only want
to say it's very stupid of Fritz not to eat his egg,
when <i>somebody</i> made them for us, extra you know,
because we're going away, and I think Fritz is very
stupid."</p>

<p>"Come, Herr Fritz," said Lisa, encouragingly,
"try and eat. You will be so hungry."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Fritz, "I've got a horrid feeling
just like when mother took me to have that big tooth
out. I feel all shaky and cruddley."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>I</i> know," said Denny, going on with <i>her</i>
breakfast all the same, "but eating's the best thing
to make it go away. I felt just that way the day I
broke grandfather's hotness measure, and mother said
I must tell him myself. I couldn't eat a bit of
dinner, and I sat on the stair all <i>screwged</i> up, waiting
for him to go to the study."</p>

<p>"How dedful!" said Baby, with great feeling.
But neither Fritz nor Celia seemed to think much of
Denny's sufferings. No one had ever seen her nerves
disturbed, and they did not therefore much believe
in her having any.</p>

<p>"Grandfather's <i>what</i> did you say?" asked Celia.</p>

<p>"His hotness measure&mdash;the little glass pipe thing
with a blob that goes up and down. He's got
another now, you know."</p>

<p>"You mean his thermometer; you really should
learn the proper names of things," said Celia, "you're
quite big enough."</p>

<p>Denny would probably not have taken this in
good part, though the "quite big enough" at the end
was very much to her taste, but there was no time
<i>this</i> morning for squabbling.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, mine children," said Lisa, "the
cart with the luggage is 'way, and the Herr Grandpapa
is buttoning his coat."</p>

<p>"And Fritz hasn't eaten his egg!" said Denny,
eyeing it dolefully, as Lisa was fastening her jacket.</p>

<p>"I <i>couldn't</i>," said Fritz. "There'll be sandwiches
or something in the train&mdash;sure to be. Now come
on; let's see what have I got to look after. Only
Tim and Peepy-Snoozle. I <i>couldn't</i> lose my satchel,
you see, for its strapped on me. Much more sensible
than <i>girls</i>, who have to carry their bags over their
arms."</p>

<p>And Fritz, in a new ulster, very long and rather
stiff, and feeling, to tell the truth, a little uncomfortable
at first, as new things generally do, stalked off&mdash;I
don't think he <i>could</i> have run!&mdash;with the air of a
very big man indeed.</p>

<p>Celia and Denny had a slight dispute as to which
was which of the bird's cages. For it had been
settled that, for the journey at least, the canaries
were to be Celia's charge and the "Bully" Denny's,
though, hitherto, these three little birds had belonged
to all the children together.</p>

<p>"You've got my cage, Denny," said Celia, sharply.</p>

<p>"I haven't," said Denny, holding hers the more
tightly. It was not very easy to see, for both were
covered up with dark blue stuff wrappers, to keep
the birds warm, "and to make them think it's night
all the way," said Baby.</p>

<p>"I haven't," repeated Denny, "there, don't you
see <i>two</i> yellow tails in yours? Peep through."</p>

<p>And Denny proved to be right, so Celia had to
give in.</p>

<p>And at last they were off! The drive to the station
safely over without any misadventures, the luggage
all locked up in the van, the children and the dormice
and the birds&mdash;far more important things, of course,
than the big people!&mdash;all comfortably settled at one
end of the nice big saloon carriage, which grandfather
had had sent down on purpose from London.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Denny, jigging up and down on
her seat, "so we're really off! How nice and springy
these cushions are! And this carriage is as big as a
little house. I could <i>never</i> be tired of travelling in a
carriage like this."</p>

<p>"Him zought we'd <i>nebber</i> get away," said Baby,
with his usual solemnity. "Dear, dear, what dedful
lots of boxes there is! Him's box is 'aside the
'normous big straw one; did zou know, Denny?"</p>

<p>"Poor grandfather," said Celia, "<i>what</i> a lot of
times he said over, 'three black portmanteaux, four,
no five canvas-covered, four carpet bags, one&mdash;fourteen
in all. Is <i>that</i> right, Helen? Grandfather's something
like Baby, he thinks no one can do anything
right but himself; and there's Peters come on purpose
to bother about these things." (Peters was grandfather's
own servant.) "I wish grandfather wouldn't
fuss so. I hate people to think he's a fussy old man,
something like Mr. Briggs in Punch. As if he had
never travelled before!"</p>

<p>As may be imagined, these remarks of Celia's were
made in a low voice, for, of course, they were intended
for the nursery party alone. Fritz flew up in grandfather's
defence.</p>

<p>"Very fine, Miss Celia," he said. "You may
laugh at grandfather for fussing, but <i>suppose</i> he didn't,
and <i>suppose</i> that when we get to&mdash;oh, bother, I can't
say those French names&mdash;wherever it is we're going
to, <i>suppose</i> that Madamazelle Celia's trunk was lost,
and Madamazelle Celia hadn't any best frocks or
flounces, or Sunday hats, how would Madamazelle
Celia look <i>then</i>? Perhaps she'd wish then that
grandfather had fussed a little."</p>

<p>Celia turned to look for her bag, and having found
it, she took out the book which she had brought with
her to read on the way.</p>

<p>"You're too silly to speak to, Fritz," she said;
"I'm going to read."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Denny, who had likewise armed
herself with a book, though she was rather a dunce
for her age, and couldn't read "runningly" as French
people say. But <i>big</i> people always had books to read
in the railway&mdash;that was enough for Denny, of course,
to try to do so too.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> going to take a nap, then," said Fritz, who was
really looking rather white and tired. He had been
wakened out of a very sound sleep this morning, and
had not been able to eat any breakfast. Lisa thought
that taking a nap was the best thing he could do, so she
got down a bundle of the rugs to make him a pillow,
and helped him to tuck up his legs comfortably, and
Fritz settled himself for his little sleep, making Lisa
promise to waken him when they came to a big station.</p>

<p>So everybody seemed inclined to be quiet. Herr
Baby's corner was by the window. He looked about
him. Celia and Denny were buried in their books,
Fritz seemed asleep already; of the big people at the
other end, grandfather's face was quite hidden in his
newspaper, which he had kept over from last night on
purpose to have something to read in the train, knowing
that they would start before the postman came in
the morning, and mother and auntie were talking
together, softly, not to disturb him.</p>

<p>"Should you like the window more open?" said
grandfather, suddenly looking up.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said auntie. "I think that little
chink is enough. It is really very cold this morning."</p>

<p>"How good the children are!" said mother. She
spoke in a lower voice than auntie; but Baby heard
her, for he had quick ears. "One could almost fancy
they were all asleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," said auntie, "if it would last all the way to
Santino, or even to Paris!"</p>

<p>"Or even to London!" said mother. "But they'll
all be jumping about like grasshoppers before long."</p>

<p>Then they went on talking softly again about other
things; and Baby didn't hear, and didn't care to hear.
Besides, he had already been taught a lesson that boys
and girls cannot learn too young, which is, that to
listen to things you are not meant to hear is a <i>sort</i> of
cheating, for it is like taking something not meant for
you. Of course, while auntie and mother were talking
in a louder voice he could not help hearing, and it was
no harm to listen, as if they had minded his hearing
they would have spoken more in a whisper.</p>

<p>Baby turned to his window to amuse himself by
looking out. First he tried to count the telegraph
wires, but he could never be sure if there were eight
or nine&mdash;he had not yet learnt to count higher than
ten&mdash;for the top ones were so tiresome, they danced
away out of sight, and all of a sudden danced down
again, and sometimes they seemed to join together, so
that he could not tell if they were one or two. He
wondered what made them wave up and down so;
whether there were men down in the ground that
pulled them, and what they did it for; he had heard
of "sending telegrams," and Denny had told him it
meant sending messages on wires, but he did not
know that these were the wires used for that. He
fancied these wires must have something to do with
the railway; perhaps they were to show the people
living in the fields that the trains were coming, so that
they shouldn't get in the way and be "runned over."
This made Baby begin to think of the people living in
the fields; they were just then passing a little cottage
standing all by itself. It looked a nice cottage, and
it had a sort of little garden round it, and some cocks
and hens were picking about. Baby looked back at
the little cottage as long as he could see it; he wondered
who lived in it, if there were any little boys and
girls, and what they did all day. He wondered if they
went to school, or if perhaps they sometimes went
messages for their mother, and if they weren't frightened
if they had to pass through the wood, which by
this time the train was running along the edge of.
Could this be Red Riding Hood's wood, perhaps?
Baby shuddered as this idea came into his mind. Or
it might be the wood that Hop-o'-my-thumb and his
six brothers had to make their way through, where the
birds <i>would</i> pick the crumbs they dropped to show the
path. It would be very "dedful" for seven little boys
to be lost in a wood like that, and still worse for one
little boy all alone. Baby was very glad that when
little boys had to go through woods <i>now</i> it was in nice
railway carriages with mothers and aunties and everybodies
with them. But even in this way the wood
made him feel a <i>very</i> little frightened; just then it got
so much darker. He looked up to see if they were all
still reading or asleep; he <i>almost</i> thought he would
ask Lisa to take him on her knee a little, when, all of
a sudden, the "railway," as he called it, screamed out
something very sharp and loud, the rattle and the noise
got "bummier" and yet sharper; Baby could see no
trees, no fields, "no nothing." What could it be? It
was worse than the wood.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lisa," cried poor Herr Baby, "the railway
horses must have runned the wrong way. We's
going down into the cellars of the world."</p>

<p>Lisa caught him up in her arms and comforted
him as well as she could. It was only a tunnel, she
told him, and she explained to him what a tunnel
was, just a sort of passage through a hill, and that
there was nothing to be frightened at. And she persuaded
him to look up and see what a nice little lamp
there was at the top of the carriage, on purpose to
light them up while they were in the dark. Baby
was quite pleased when he saw the little lamp.</p>

<p>"Who put it 'zere?" he said. "Were it God?"</p>

<p>He was rather disappointed when Lisa told him
that it was the railway men who put it up, but then
he thought again that it was very kind of the railway
men, and that it must have been God who taught
them to be so kind, which Lisa quite agreed in. But
even though the little lamp was very nice, Baby was
very pleased to get out of the tunnel, and out of the
rumbly, rattly noise, into the open daylight again,
with the beautiful sun shining down at them out of
the sky. For the day was growing brighter as it
went on, and the air was a little frosty, which made
everything look clear and fresh.</p>

<p>"Nice sun," said Baby, glancing up at his old
friend in the sky, "that's the bestest lamp of all, isn't
it? and it <i>were</i> God put it up there."</p>

<p>After that he must, I think, have taken a little
nap in Lisa's arms almost without knowing it, for he
didn't seem to hear anything more or to think where
he was or anything, till all of a sudden he heard
mother's voice speaking.</p>

<p>"Won't Baby have a sandwich, Lisa? And
Denny, why, have you been asleep too, Denny?"</p>

<p>And sitting up on Lisa's knee, all rosy and
dimpled with sleeping, his fair curls in a pretty
tumble about his eyes, Baby saw Denny, looking
very sleepy too, but trying hard to hide it.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, smoothing down her hair and
sitting up very straight, "I've been reading such a
long time that my eyes got quite tired; that was
why I shut them."</p>

<p>"Oh indeed!" said mother, but Baby could see
that she was smiling at Denny, though she didn't
laugh right out like Fritz and Celia.</p>

<p>They were all very happy, however, with their
sandwiches and buns, and after they had eaten as
much as they wanted, auntie taught them a sort of
guessing game, which helped to pass the time, for
already Denny and Fritz were beginning to think
even the big saloon carriage rather a small room to
spend a whole day in.</p>

<p>They passed two or three big stations, and then
they were allowed to get out and walk up and down
the platform a little, which was a nice change. But
Baby was so dreadfully afraid of any of them being
left behind that he could hardly be persuaded to get
out at all, and once when he and Lisa were waiting
alone in the carriage while the others walked about,
and the train moved on a little way to another part,
he screamed so loudly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, oh, auntie, oh, ganfather, and Celia,
and Fritz, and Denny! All, all is left behind!"&mdash;that
there was quite a commotion in the station, and
when the train moved back again, and they all got in,
he was obliged to kiss and hug each one separately,
several times over, before he could feel quite sure he
had them all safe and sound, and that "not nobody"
was missing.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time after it got dark, even
though the little lamp was still lighted. But it was
not light enough to see to read, and "the big lamp
up in the sky," as Baby said, "was <i>kite</i> goned away."
It puzzled him very much how the sun could go
away every night and come back every morning, and
the queerest thing of all was what Celia had told him&mdash;that
"away there," in the far-off country where
they were going, there would still be the same sun,
the <i>very</i> same sun, that they had seen every morning
peeping up behind the kitchen-garden wall, and
whose red face they had said good-night to on the
winter evenings, as he slipped away to bed down
below the old elms in the avenue, where the rooks
had their nests. Somehow as Baby sat in his corner,
staring out now and then at the darkness through
which they were whizzing, blinking up sometimes at
the little lamp shining faintly in the roof, there came
before his mind the pictures of all they had left
behind; he seemed to see the garden and the trees <i>so</i>
plain, and he thought how very, very quiet and lonely
it must seem there now, and Baby's little heart grew
sad. He felt so sorry for all the things they had
left&mdash;the rabbits and the pussy most of all, of course,
but even for the dear old trees, and the sweet,
"denkle" flowers in the garden; even for the tables
and chairs in the house he felt sorry.</p>

<p>"Him's poor little bed will be so cold and lonely,"
he said to himself. "Him sinks going away is
<i>werry</i> sad."</p>

<p>Grandfather had fixed that it would be best to go
straight through at once to the seaport, where, the next
morning, they would find the 'normous boat waiting
to take them over the sea. They had to pass through
London on the way, and, by the time they got to the
big London station, Baby was very tired&mdash;so white
and quiet that mother was a little frightened.</p>

<p>"I almost wish," she said, "that we had fixed to
stay all night in London. Baby has never had a
long railway journey before, since he was a <i>real</i>
Baby, you know, and he is not very strong."</p>

<p>She was speaking to auntie. It was just when
they were getting near the big London station.
Auntie looked at Baby. He was lying on Lisa's
knee with his eyes shut, as if he were asleep, but he
wasn't. He heard what they said, and he was
rather pleased at them talking about him. In
<i>some</i> ways he was very fond of being made a fuss
about.</p>

<p>"He does look a little white shrimp," said auntie.
"But then you know, May, he is so fair. He looks
more quickly white if he is tired than other children.
And he has been such a good little man all day&mdash;not
one bit of trouble. He is really a capital traveller&mdash;<i>ever</i>
so much quieter than the others."</p>

<p>She said these last few words in a low tone, not
caring for the other children to hear; but if she had
spoken quite loud I don't think they would have
heard, and, indeed, it seemed as if they wanted to
show that auntie's words were true; for just at that
moment there came such a scream from Denny that
everybody started up in a fright.</p>

<p>What <i>could</i> be the matter? everybody asked.</p>

<p>"It's all Denny," said Fritz, in a great fuss.</p>

<p>"It's not; it's all Fritz and Celia," said Denny.</p>

<p>"It's both of them," said Celia. "Mother, I wish
you wouldn't let them be near each other. Denny
put her hand into the dormice's cage when Fritz
wasn't looking, and she poked out Tim, who was just
beginning to come awake for the night, and she as
nearly as <i>could</i> be got his tail pulled off, and then,
when Fritz caught her, she screamed."</p>

<p>"Fritz snipped my hand in the little door of the
cage," sobbed Denny. "And Celia always takes
Fritz's part."</p>

<p>Celia was beginning; to "answer back," when
auntie stopped her by a look&mdash;the children were
sometimes rather afraid of auntie's "looks."</p>

<p>"Dear me, young people," said grandfather from
his end of the carriage, "you might be peaceable for
five minutes, and then we shall be in London, and
you shall have a good tea before we go on again."</p>

<p>The children all grew quiet. They were glad to
hear of tea, and they were a little ashamed of themselves.
Auntie moved over to their end of the
carriage.</p>

<p>"Him would like some tea too, p'ease," said Baby,
as she passed him, and auntie patted his head.</p>

<p>"They are all tired, I suppose," said mother;
"but it really is too silly, the way they quarrel about
nothing."</p>

<p>"Auntie," said Celia softly, "I think it was partly
my fault. Denny and Fritz asked me to tell them a
story, and I wouldn't. It would have kept them
quiet."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind now," said auntie. "You
must all try and be very good to-morrow. This is
only the first day, you know. You can't be expected
to be very clever travellers yet. And the very first
lesson to learn in travelling is&mdash;do you know what?"</p>

<p>"Not to lose your things?" said Celia.</p>

<p>"To be ready in time?" said Fritz.</p>

<p>"To sit still in the railway?" said Denny, rather
meekly.</p>

<p>"All those are very good things," said auntie;
"but they're not <i>the</i> thing I was thinking of. It was
<i>to keep your temper</i>."</p>

<p>The children got rather red, but I don't think any
one noticed, for already the train was slackening, and
in another minute or two they all got out and were
standing together on the bustling platform, dimly
lighted up by the gas lamps, which looked yellow and
strange in the foggy air of a London November
evening.</p>

<p>"Is zit London?" said Baby, and when Celia said
"yes," he added rather mournfully, "Him doesn't
sink London's pitty at all."</p>

<p>Poor little boys, for, after all, Fritz himself wasn't
very big! They stood together hand in hand on the
station platform, looking, and feeling, rather desolate.
Lisa was busy helping with the rugs and bags that
had been in the carriage; mother and auntie, as well
as grandfather and Peters and the maid, were all busy
about the luggage.</p>

<p>"Stay there a moment, children," said somebody;
but Denny had no idea of staying anywhere. Off she
trotted to have a look at the luggage too, and Celia
was half inclined to follow her, when her glance fell
on her two little brothers.</p>

<p>"Celia," said Baby, catching hold of her, "don't
go away too. Fritz is taking care of him, but we
<i>might</i> be lostened."</p>

<p>He spoke rather timidly, and Celia's heart was
touched. She was a good deal older than the others&mdash;nearly
twelve&mdash;Fritz and Denny were very near in
age, and sometimes Celia was a little cross at mother
for not making difference enough, as she thought, and
for keeping her still a good deal in the nursery.
Mother had her own good reasons, and it is not always
wise for big people to tell children their reasons,
as Celia got to know when she grew wiser and bigger
herself. She sometimes spoke rather crossly to the
younger ones, and it made them a very little afraid
of her, but in her heart she was kind. Just now she
stooped down to kiss Baby.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, poor old man," she said,
"you won't be lost. Fritz wouldn't let you be lost,
would you, Fritz?"</p>

<p>Fritz brightened up at that, as Celia had meant
he should. He, too, had been feeling a little strange
and queer&mdash;the long journey and the sleeping in the
day, all so different from their life at home, had
rather upset him&mdash;but he would not have liked to say so!
And now he was quite pleased at Celia telling Baby
that, of course, Fritz was big enough to take care of
him. It is so easy for children&mdash;bigger ones above all&mdash;to
please each other and give nice feelings, when they
really try to feel <i>with</i> each other and <i>for</i> each other.</p>

<p>The little boys looked much happier a few minutes
later, when they were seated at tea in a comfortable
corner of the refreshment room. Grandfather had
sent Peters on, as soon as they had got the luggage
all safe, to see that a table was placed for them by
themselves. He, himself, went off to get some real
dinner, for, of course, it was not to be expected that
a gentleman, and especially an <i>old</i> gentleman, would
be contented with tea, and bread and butter, and
buns, however nice, but, to the children's great pleasure,
mother and auntie said <i>they</i> would far rather
stay and have tea with the little people.</p>

<p>"It is a good thing, isn't it, for them to stay with
us?" said Fritz to Celia, confidentially, "for we are
none of us <i>very</i> big, are we? And you know we
<i>might</i> get lost somehow, as Baby says, though I
wouldn't say so to him for fear of frightening him,
you know."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Celia, and looking up
she was pleased to see mother smiling at her.
Mother saw that Celia was trying to be kind and
helpful, and she did so like to see the way the little
ones clung to Celia when she was gentle. Mother
must have been something like Baby in her mind, I
think, for when she looked at the boys sitting there
in the strange, big station-room, their little faces
grave and rather tired looking, a sort of sorry feeling
came over <i>her</i> too, as she thought of the snug, cosy
nursery at home, and the neat nursery tea, with the
pretty pink and white cups she had chosen, and the
canaries and "Bully" twittering in the window.
Poor "calanies" and poor Bully! they didn't know
where they had got to! They had slept nearly all
day, thinking, as they were meant to think, that it
was night, I suppose, but now they must have given
up thinking so, for they were fidgeting about in their
cages in an unhappy, restless sort of way. They
had plenty of seed, and Celia and Lisa took care that
they should have fresh water, but still, poor little
things, they were not very happy.</p>

<p>"Going away from their own home is really a trial
for children," thought mother. She was a little tired
herself, and being tired makes <i>everything</i> seem the
wrong way.</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. They had all to
make the best of things, and to set off again in
another train and be rattled away to the sea. It was
quite dark by now, of course, and it seemed very
queer to start on another journey with so little rest
between. I think, however, once they were all
settled in the railway carriage, that the children slept
the most of the way; Baby, at any rate, knew nothing
more till he woke up to find himself in Lisa's arms,
with a cold, fresh air&mdash;the air of the sea&mdash;blowing in
his face, and making him lift up his head and look
about him.</p>

<p>"Where is him?" he said. "Is him in the
'normous boat?"</p>

<p>"Not so, Herr Baby," said Lisa. "He shall first
be undressed and have a nice sleep all night in bed,
to rest him well. Lie still, mine child, and Lisa will
keep you warm."</p>

<p>"Him likes the wind," said Baby. "It blowed
his eyes open; him is quite awake now," and he tried
to sit straight up in Lisa's arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Herr Baby, I cannot hold you so," said Lisa.</p>

<p>"There is such a little way to go," said his
mother, who was just behind, "lie still, dear, as Lisa
tells you."</p>

<p>"Him would like to walk, him's legs is so 'tiff,"
said Baby. "P'ease let him walk if it's such a little
way!"</p>

<p>His voice was so piteous that mother told Lisa to
let him walk; they were going from the station to the
hotel, a very little way, as mother had said. Lisa put
Baby down on the ground; at first he really tumbled
over, his legs felt so funny, but with Lisa's hand he
soon got his balance again. It was a very dark night;
they could not have seen their way but for the lights
of the station and the town.</p>

<p>"What a dark countly zit is!" said Herr Baby.
"Is there no moon in zit countly? Denny says in
her hymn 'the moon to shine by night,' is there no
moon 'cept in him's own countly?"</p>

<p>"What are you chattering about, little man?" said
auntie.</p>

<p>"He's asking about the moon, auntie; he wants
to know if there isn't any moon here. He thinks
we've left it behind at home," said Denny.</p>

<p>A sort of roar from poor Baby interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Denny, don't, <i>don't</i> say that," he cried, "it
makes him sink of the labbits, and Thomas, and
Jones, and the trees, and the flowers, and him's dear
little bed, and all the sings we'se leaved behind.
Him doesn't like you to speak of leaved behind."</p>

<p>"<i>Poor</i> Baby," said Denny, "I'm so sorry." She
stooped down to kiss him, but it was so dark it wasn't
easy to find his mouth, and she only managed to kiss
the tip of his nose, which was as cold as a little dog's.
This made Herr Baby begin laughing, which was a
good thing, wasn't it? And he was so taken up in
explaining to Lisa how funny it felt when Denny
kissed his nose, that he had not time to think of his
sorrows again till they were at the foot of the large
flight of steps leading up to the big hotel where they
were to sleep.</p>

<p>"Nice big house," said Baby, looking round; and
as he caught sight of some of the waiters running
about, he asked Lisa if "them was new servants
instead of Thomas and Jones."</p>

<p>"Him likes Thomas and Jones best," he went on,
the corners of his mouth going down again, so that
Lisa was obliged to assure him the servants were not
going to be <i>instead</i> of Thomas and Jones, they were
all only just going to stay one night at this big house,
and to-morrow they would set off in the great ship to
cross the sea.</p>

<p>The mention of the ship fortunately gave a new
turn to Baby's thoughts; and he allowed Lisa to take
him upstairs and warm him well before a good fire
before she undressed him and put him to bed. The
other children thought it great fun to sleep in strange
rooms, in beds quite unlike those they had at home,
and to have to hunt for their nightgowns and brushes
and sponges in two or three <i>wrong</i> carpet bags before
they came to the right one; but Baby's spirits were
rather depressed, and it was not easy to keep him from
crying in the sad little way he had when his feelings
were touched.</p>

<p>"He is tired, poor little chap," said auntie, as she
kissed him for good-night. "It is ever so much later
than he has ever been up before. It is nearly ten."</p>

<p>"Him <i>were</i> up till ten o'clock on Kissmass," said
Herr Baby, brightening up. "Him were up <i>dedful</i>
late, till, till, p'raps till near twenty o'clock."</p>

<p>Auntie would have liked to laugh, but she took
care not, for when Baby was in this sort of humour
there was no telling whether other people's laughing
might not make him take to crying, so she just said,</p>

<p>"Indeed! That must have been <i>very</i> late; well, go
to sleep now, and sleep till twenty o'clock to-morrow
morning, if you like. We don't need to start early,"
she added, turning to Lisa; and I think poor Lisa was
not sorry to hear it!</p>

<p>If I were to go on telling you, bit by bit, all about
the journey, and everything that happened big and
little, it would take a good while, and I don't know
that you would find it very interesting. Perhaps it is
better to take a jump, as people do in real big story
books, and to go on with Herr Baby's adventures a
few days later, when he, and Denny, and Fritz, and
Celia, and Lisa, and mother, and auntie, and grandfather,
and the "bully," and the "calanies," and Tim,
and Peepy-Snoozle, and Linley, mother's maid, and
Peters, grandfather's man, and I forget if there was
any one else, but I think not; and all the boxes and
carpet-bags, and railway-rugs, were safely arrived at
Santino, the pretty little town with mountains on one
side and the sea on the other, where they were all
going to spend the winter. I must not forget to
tell you one thing, however, which, I daresay, some
of you who may have crossed "over the sea," and <i>not</i>
found it very delightful, may be anxious to know about.
I mean about the voyage in the 'normous boat, which
Baby had been so looking forward to, poor little fellow.</p>

<p>Well, wasn't it lucky, he was not at all disappointed?
They had the loveliest day that ever was
seen, and Baby thought 'normous boats far the nicest
way of travelling, and he couldn't understand why
grandfather couldn't make them go all the way to
Santino in the nice boat, and when they explained to
him that it couldn't be, because there was no sea for
boats to go on all the way, he thought there must have
been some great mistake in the way the world was
made. And when they got to Santino, and the first
thing he saw <i>was</i> the sea, blue and beautiful like a
fairy dream, Baby was quite startled.</p>

<p>"Mother, auntie!" he said, reproachfully, "you
toldened him there weren't no sea."</p>

<p>"We didn't mean that, Baby, dear," said mother;
"we meant that there was no sea to come the shortest
way; we would have had to come all round the land,
and it would have been much longer. Look, it is
like this," and mother traced with her parasol a sort
of map on the sand, to show Baby that they had
come a much nearer way. For they were standing
by the sea-shore at the time.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Herr Baby, after looking on without
speaking for a minute or two, "him under'tands
now."</p>

<p>"So you've had your first lesson in geography,"
said auntie.</p>

<p>Baby stared up at her.</p>

<p>"Are <i>that</i> jography?" he said. "Him thought
jography were awful, dedful difficult. Denny is so
<i>werry</i> c'oss when her has jography to learn."</p>

<p>"Oh, because, of course, you know," said Denny,
getting rather red, "<i>my</i> jography is <i>real</i> jography,
with books and maps and ever so long rows of names
to learn. Baby's so stupid&mdash;he always takes up
things so; he'll be thinking now that if he makes
marks on the sand, he'll be learning jography."</p>

<p>Denny turned away with a very superior air.
Baby looked much hurt.</p>

<p>"Him's not stupid, <i>are</i> him?" he said; and in a
moment Celia and Fritz were hugging him and calling
Denny a naughty, unkind girl to tease him. Mother
and auntie had walked on a little, so things <i>might</i>
have gone on to a quarrel if Lisa hadn't stopped it.</p>

<p>"Mine children," she said, "it is too pity to be
not friendly together. See what one beautifullest
place this is&mdash;sky so blue and sea so blue, and all so
bright and sunny. One should be nothing but happy
here."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Celia, looking round, "it is an awfully
pretty place."</p>

<p>Celia, you see, was just beginning to be old enough
to notice really beautiful things in a way that when
children are <i>very</i> little, they cannot quite understand,
though some do much more than others.</p>

<p>"It is a <i>very</i> pretty place," she said again, as if
she were speaking to herself, for Fritz and Denny
had taken it into their heads to run races, of which
Lisa was very glad, and Celia stood still by herself,
looking round at the lovely sea and sky, and the
little white town perched up above, with the mountains
rising behind. Suddenly a little hand was
slipped into hers.</p>

<p>"Him would like to live here everways," said
Baby's voice; "it <i>are</i> so pitty&mdash;somefin like Heaven,
p'raps."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Celia, "I suppose Heaven
must be prettier than anything we could fancy."</p>

<p>"There's gold streets in Heaven, Lisa says," said
Baby; "him sinks blue sky streets would be much pittier."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Celia.</p>

<p>Then they walked on a little, watching Fritz and
Denny, already like two black specks in front&mdash;they
had run on so far&mdash;and, somehow, in the <i>very</i> bright
sunshine, one seemed to see less clearly. Mother and
auntie were in front too, and when Fritz and Denny
raced back again, quite hot and out of breath, mother
said it was time for them all to go in; it was still
rather too hot to be out much near the middle of the
day, though it was already some way on in November,
and next month would be the month that Christmas
comes in!</p>

<p>"How funny it seems," said Celia. "Why, when
we left home it was quite winter. Just think how
we were wrapped up when we started on the journey,
and now we're quite warm enough with nothing at
all over our frocks."</p>

<p>"It may be cold enough before long," said mother,
who was more accustomed to hot climates than the
children; "sometimes the cold hereabouts comes
quite suddenly, and it even seems colder from having
been so warm before. I daresay you will be glad of
your thick clothes before Christmas. But we must
get on a little quicker, or else grandfather will be in
a hurry for his breakfast."</p>

<p>"Ganfather's werry lazy not to have had him's
breakfast yet," said Baby. "<i>Him's</i> had <i>him's</i> breakfast
ever so long ago, hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, Baby," said Denny, "how you do 'saggerate!
It <i>couldn't</i> have been hundreds of years ago, because,
you know, you weren't born then."</p>

<p>"Stupid girl!" said Baby, "how does you know?
you wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> weren't there," said Denny again.</p>

<p>"Children, don't contradict each other. It's not
nice," said auntie.</p>

<p>"Him didn't begin," said Baby, "t'were Denny
beginned."</p>

<p>"I didn't. I only said <i>once</i> that Baby wasn't
born hundreds of years ago," said Denny, "and then
he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Onst is as wurst as twicet," said Baby.</p>

<p>Mother turned round at this. There was a funny
look on her face, but still she spoke rather gravely.</p>

<p>"Baby, I don't know what's coming over you," she
said. "It isn't like you to speak like that."</p>

<p>Baby's face grew red, and he turned his head
away.</p>

<p>"Him didn't mean <i>zeally</i> that ganfather were
lazy," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It wasn't <i>that</i> I was vexed with you for," said
mother. "I know you were joking when you said
that. I meant what you said to Denny."</p>

<p>"Him's werry sorry," said Baby, on the point of
tears.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Don't cry about it," said mother,
who really wanted the children to be very good and
happy this first day. And she was a little afraid of
Baby's beginning to cry, for, <i>sometimes</i>, once he had
begun, it was not very easy to stop him.</p>

<p>"You don't understand about grandfather and his
breakfast," said auntie. "Here nobody has big breakfast
when they first get up except you children, who
have the same that you have at home."</p>

<p>"No we don't," said Denny. "At home we have
bread and milk every day except Sunday&mdash;on Sunday
we have bacon or heggs, because that's the nothing-for-breakfast
day."</p>

<p>Auntie stared at Denny.</p>

<p>"Really, Denny," she said, "it is sometimes a little
difficult to be sure that you have got all your senses.
How can you have 'nothing for breakfast' when you
have bacon, and&mdash;who in the world ever taught you
to say 'heggs'?"</p>

<p>"I meant to say 'neggs,'" said Denny very humbly.
"Grandfather laughed at me because I didn't say
'hippotamus' right&mdash;I called it a 'nippotamus,' and
he made me say 'hi-hi-hip,' and that's got me into
the way of saying it to everything, like calling a negg,
a hegg."</p>

<p>"A <i>negg</i>," repeated auntie slowly. "Can't you
hear any difference between 'a negg,' and 'an egg'?
Spell, a-n an, e-g-g egg."</p>

<p>Denny repeated it.</p>

<p>"What dedful jography Denny's having," observed
Baby; "I can say <i>a negg, quite</i> right."</p>

<p>"And so you too call 'a negg' nothing for breakfast?"
said auntie.</p>

<p>"Neggs and bacon is nothing for breakfast," answered
Baby.</p>

<p>"Auntie," said Fritz, "you don't understand. We
call it nothing for breakfast when there's not bread-and-milk,
you know, for on bread-and-milk days we
have just one little cup of tea and a bit of bread-and-butter
after the bread-and-milk. But on Sundays,
and birthdays, there's nothing for the <i>first</i>, and so we
get better things, more like big people, and tea, and
whatever there is, as soon as we begin. That's why
we like 'nothing for breakfast,' do you see, auntie?"</p>

<p>"I see," said auntie, "but I certainly couldn't
have guessed. I hope there's <i>something</i> for breakfast
to-day for us, for I'm very hungry, and look, there's
grandfather coming out to meet us, which looks as if
he were hungry too. And what have you to say to
it, old man?" she added, as Herr Baby came up the
steps, one foot at a time, of course, "aren't you hungry
after your walk?"</p>

<p>"Him's hungry for him's <i>dinner</i>, but not for him's
<i>breakfast</i>; in course not," said Baby, with great
dignity.</p>

<p>Baby and Fritz went out a walk that afternoon in
the town with auntie and Lisa. Celia and Denny
had gone for a drive with mother and grandfather,
which the big people thought would make a good
division. Grandfather was very fond of children,
but in a carriage, he used to say, <i>two</i> small people
were enough of a good thing. So Celia and Denny
worried Lisa to get out their best hats and jackets&mdash;which
were not unpacked, as grandfather had not
yet decided whether they should stay at the hotel or
get a house for themselves&mdash;and set off in great
spirits on the back seat of the carriage.</p>

<p>Fritz and Baby were in very good spirits too.
Fritz wanted to walk along the sort of front street of
the town which faced the sea, for he was never tired
of looking at boats and ships. Baby liked them too,
but what he most wanted to see was the shops.
Baby was very fond of shops. He was fond of buying
things, but before he bought anything he used to like
to be quite sure which was the best shop to get it at&mdash;I
mean to say at which shop he could get it best&mdash;and
he often asked the price two or three times before
he fixed. And he had never before seen so many
shops or such pretty and curious ones as there were
at Santino, so he was quite delighted, though if you
hadn't known him well you would hardly have
guessed it, for he trotted along as grave as a little
judge, only staring about him with all his eyes.</p>

<p>And indeed there were plenty of things to stare at.
Fritz's tongue went very fast. He wanted auntie to stop
every minute to look at something wonderful. The
carts drawn by oxen pleased him and Baby very much.</p>

<p>"That's the working cows they told us about,"
said Fritz. "They're very nice, but I think I like
horses best, don't you, Baby?"</p>

<p>"No, him likes cows best," said Baby, "when
him's a man him will have a calliage wif hundreds
of cows to pull it along, and wif lots and lots of gold
bells all tinkling. Won't that be lubly?"</p>

<p>"Not half so nice as a lot of ponies, all with bells,"
said Fritz, "they'd make ever so much more jingling,
'cos they go so fast. Isn't it funny to see all the
women with handkerchers on their heads and no
bonnets, Baby?"</p>

<p>"When him's a man," said Baby again&mdash;he was
growing more talkative now&mdash;"when him's a man,
him's going to have auntie and Lisa," auntie and
Lisa came first, of course, because they happened to
be in his sight, "and mother, and Celia, and Denny
<i>all</i> for his wifes, and them shall all wear most bootly
hankerwifs on them's heads, red and blue and pink
and every colour, and gold&mdash;lots of gold."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said auntie, "but by that time my
hair, for one, will be quite gray; I shall be quite an
old woman. I don't think such splendid trappings
would suit me."</p>

<p>"Him said <i>handkerwifs</i>, not traps&mdash;him doesn't
know what traps is," said Baby. "And him will be
werry kind to you when you're old. Him will always
let you come in and warm yourself, and give you
halfpennies."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, I'm sure you will," said auntie.
But she and Fritz looked at each other. That was
one of Herr Baby's ideas, and they couldn't get him
to understand, so mother settled it was better to
leave it and he'd understand of himself when he
grew bigger. He thought that <i>everybody</i>, however
rich and well off they might be, had to grow quite,
quite poor, and to beg for pennies in the streets before
they died. Wasn't it a funny fancy? It was not
till a good while afterwards that mother found out
that what had made him think so was the word
"old." He couldn't understand that growing old
could mean only growing old in years&mdash;he thought
it meant as well, poor and worn-out, like his own
little old shoes. Just now it would have been no
good trying to explain, even if mother had quite
understood what was in his mind, which she didn't
till he told her himself long after. For it only made
him cry when people tried to explain and <i>he</i> couldn't
explain what he meant. There was nothing vexed
him so much! And I think there was something
rather nice mixed up with this funny idea about
getting old. It made Baby wish to be so kind to all
poor old people. He would look at any poor old
beggar in such a strange sad way, and he always
<i>begged</i> to be allowed to give them a penny. And,
though no one knew of it, in his own mind he was
thinking that his dear little mother or his kind
auntie would be like that some day, and he would
like rich little boys to be kind to them then, just as
he was now to other poor old people. Of course, he
said to himself, "If <i>him</i> sees dear little mother and
auntie when they get old, <i>him</i> will take care of them
and let them rest at his house every time they come
past, but <i>p'raps</i> him might be far away then."</p>

<p>And sometimes, when grandfather spoke about
getting old and how white his hair was growing,
Baby would look at him very gravely, for in his own
mind he was wondering if the time was very soon
coming for poor grandfather to be an old beggar-man.
Baby thought it <i>had</i> to be, you see, he thought it
was just what must come to everybody.</p>

<p>Just as auntie and he had finished talking about
getting old they turned a corner and went down a
street which led them away from the view of the sea.
This street had shops at both sides, and some of them
were very pretty, but they were not the kind of shops
that the little boys cared much for&mdash;they were mostly
dressmakers' and milliners' and shawl shops. Lots
of grand dresses and hats and bonnets were to be
seen, which would have pleased Celia and Denny
perhaps, but which Fritz said were very stupid.
Auntie did not seem to care for them either&mdash;she was
in a hurry to go to an office where she was going to
ask about a house that might do for them. So she
walked on quickly, as quickly at least as Baby's
short legs could go, for she held him by the hand,
and Fritz and Lisa came behind. They left this
street in a minute and crossed through two or three
others before auntie could find the one she wanted.
Suddenly Baby gave her a tug.</p>

<p>"Oh auntie," he said, "p'ease 'top one minute.
Him sees shiny glass jugs like dear little mother's.
Oh, do 'top."</p>

<p>Auntie stopped. They were passing what is
called an old curiosity shop; it was a funny looking
place, seeming very crowded even though it was a
large shop, for it was so very full of all sorts of queer
things. Some among them were more queer than
pretty, but some were very pretty too, and in one
corner of the window there were several jugs, and
cups, and bottles, and such things, of very fine glass,
with the same sort of soft-coloured shine on it that
Baby remembered in the two jugs that he had pulled
down in the tiny trunk. Baby's eyes had spied them
out at once.</p>

</div>

<p>"Look, look, auntie," he said, again gently tugging
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Baby dear, very pretty," said auntie, but
without paying much attention to the glass, for she
was not thinking of Baby's adventure in the pantry
at the moment, and did not know what jugs of his
mother's he meant.</p>

<p>"There is two <i>just</i> like mother's," said Baby, but
he spoke lower now, almost as if he were speaking to
himself. An idea had come into his mind which he
had hardly yet understood himself, and he did not
want to speak of it to any one else. He just stood at
the window staring in, his two eyes fixed on the glass
jugs, and the great question he was saying to himself
was, "How many pennies would they cost?"</p>

<p>"Them's a little smaller, him sinks," he murmured,
"but p'raps mother wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>It was a mistake of his that they were smaller;
they were really a little larger than the broken ones.
Besides Baby had never seen the broken ones till
they <i>were</i> broken. One of them had been much less
smashed than the other, and mother had examined it
to see if it could possibly be mended so as to look
pretty as an ornament, even though it would never
do to hold water, and, when she found nothing could
be done, she had told Thomas to keep the top part of
it as a sort of pattern, in case she ever had a chance
of getting the same. I think I forgot to explain this
to you before, and you may have wondered how Baby
knew so well what the jugs had been like.</p>

<p>"Them is a little smaller," he said again to himself.
He did not understand that things often look
smaller when they are among a great many others of
the same kind, and though there was not a very great
deal of the shiny glass in the shop window, there
was enough to make it rather a wonder that such a
little boy as Baby had caught sight of the two jugs
at all, for they were behind the rest. He had time
to look at them well, for, though auntie had been
rather in a hurry, she, too, stood still in front of the
shop, for something had caught her eyes too.</p>

<p>"How <i>very</i> pretty, how sweet!" she said to herself,
"I wish I could copy it. It seems to me beautifully
done," and when Fritz, who had not found the
shop so interesting as the others had done, in his
turn gave her a tug and said, "Auntie, aren't you
coming?" she pointed out to him what it was she
was so pleased with.</p>

<p>"Isn't it sweet, Fritz?" said auntie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fritz, "but it's rather dirty, auntie,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Fritz was very, what is called, <i>practical</i>. The
"it" that auntie was speaking about was an old picture,
hanging up on the wall at the side of the door.
It was the portrait of a little girl, a very little girl, of
not more than three or four years old. She had a
dear little face, sweet and bright, and yet somehow a
very little sad, or else it was the long-ago make of
the dress, and the faded look of the picture itself,
beside the baby-like face that made it <i>seem</i> sad. You
couldn't help thinking the moment you saw it, "Dear
me, that little girl must be a very old woman by now
or most likely she must be dead!" I think it was
that that made one feel sad on first looking at the
picture, for, after all, the face <i>was</i> bright and happy-looking:
the rosy, roguish, little mouth was smiling,
the soft blue eyes had a sort of twinkling fun in
them, though they were so soft, and the fair hair, so
fair that it almost seemed white, drawn up rather
tight in an old-fashioned way, fell back again on one
side as if little Blue-eyes had just been having a good
run. And one fat, dimpled shoulder was poked out
of the prim white frock in a way that, I daresay, had
rather shocked the little girl's mother when the painter
first showed her his work, for our little, old, great-great-grandfathers'
and great-great-grandmothers',
children, must have had to sit very, very still in
their very best and stiffest frocks and suits when
their pictures were painted, poor little things! They
were not so lucky as you are nowadays, who have
only to go to the photograph man's for half an hour,
and keep your merry faces still for a quarter of a
minute, if your mothers want to have a picture of
you!</p>

<p>But Blue-eyes must have had some fun when <i>her</i>
picture was painted, I think, or else that little shoulder
wouldn't have got leave to poke itself out of its sleeve,
and there wouldn't have been that mischievous look
about the comers of her mouth.</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> it a little dirty, auntie?" said Fritz.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't your face look a little dirty if it had
been hanging up in a frame for over a hundred
years?" said auntie, laughing, at which Fritz looked
rather puzzled.</p>

<p>Then auntie's eyes went back to the picture again.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> sweet," she said, "very, very sweet, and so
perfectly natural."</p>

<p>All this time, as I told you, Herr Baby's whole
mind had been given to the shiny glasses. Suddenly
the sound of his aunt's voice caught his ear, and he
looked up.</p>

<p>"What is it that is so 'weet, auntie?" he said.</p>

<p>"The picture over there, dear. Hanging up by
the door. The little girl."</p>

<p>Baby looked up, and in a moment his eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a <i>dear</i> little baby!" he said. "Oh, her
<i>is</i> 'weet! Auntie, him would so like to kiss her."</p>

<p>"You darling!" said auntie, her glance turning
from the sweet picture face above to the sweet living
face beside her. "I wonder if you will ever learn to
paint like that, Baby. <i>I</i> should very much like to
copy it if I could have the loan of it. It would be
sure to be very dear to buy," she added to herself.
"But we must hurry, my little boys," she went on.
"I was tempted to waste time admiring the picture,
but we must be quick."</p>

<p>Fritz and Lisa turned away with auntie, but Baby
waited one moment behind. He pressed his face
close against the shop window and whispered softly,</p>

<p>"Pitty little girl, him would like to kiss you.
Him will come a 'nother day. P'ease, pitty little girl,
don't let nobody take away the shiny glasses, for him
wants to buy them for mother."</p>

<p>Then, quite satisfied, he trotted down the street
after the others, who were waiting for him a few
doors off.</p>

<p>"Were you saying good-bye to the picture, Baby?"
said auntie, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby gravely.</p>

<p>Auntie soon found the office where she was to
hear about the house they were thinking of taking.
The little boys stood beside her and listened gravely
while she asked questions about it, though they
couldn't understand what was said.</p>

<p>"Him wishes the people in this countly wouldn't
talk lubbish talk," said Herr Baby to Fritz with a sigh.
"Him would so like to know what them says."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> want to know if we're going to have a house
with a garden," said Fritz. "That's all <i>I</i> care about,"
and as soon as they were out in the street again, he
asked auntie if "the man" had said there was a
garden to the house.</p>

<p>"There are several houses that I have to tell your
grandfather about," said auntie. "Some have gardens
and some haven't, but the one we like the best has
a garden, though not a very big one."</p>

<p>"Not as big as the one at home?" said Fritz.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no, of course not," said auntie. "It is
quite different here from at home. People only come
to stay a short time, they wouldn't care to be troubled
with big gardens."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Fritz amiably, "if only it's
big enough for us to have a corner to dig in, and somewhere
to play in when Lisa's in a fussy humour."</p>

<p>"Mine child," said Lisa mildly. Poor Lisa, she
was not a very fussy person! Indeed she was rather
too easy for such lively young people as Fritz and
Denny.</p>

<p>"And do you want a garden, too, very much,
Baby?" said auntie.</p>

<p>Baby had hardly heard what they were saying.
His mind was still running on the shiny jugs and
the blue-eyed little girl.</p>

<p>"Him wants gate lots of pennies," he said, which
didn't seem much of an answer to auntie's question.</p>

<p>"Lots of pennies, my little man," said auntie.
"What do you want lots of pennies for?"</p>

<p>But Baby would not tell.</p>

<p>Just then they saw coming towards them in the
street two very funny looking men. They had no
hats or caps on their heads, so the children could see
that they had no hair either, at least none on the top,
where it was shaved quite off, and only a sort of fringe
all round left. Then they had queer loose brown coats,
with big capes, something like grandfather's Inverness
cloak, Fritz thought, and silver chains hanging down
at their sides, and, queerest of all, no stockings or
proper boots or shoes, only things like the <i>soles</i> of
shoes strapped on to their bare feet. These were
called sandals, auntie said, and she told the boys that
these funny looking men were monks, "Franciscans,"
she said they were called. They all lived together,
and they never kept any money, and people said&mdash;but
auntie thought that was not quite true&mdash;that they
never washed themselves.</p>

<p>"Nasty dirty men," said Fritz, making a face.
"I shouldn't like to be a Franciscan."</p>

<p>"Not in winter, Fritz?" said Baby. "Him
wouldn't mind in winter when the water <i>are</i> so cold.
Lisa," he went on, turning round to his nurse, "'member&mdash;when
the <i>werry</i> cold mornings comes, him's
going to be a Frantisker&mdash;will you 'member, Lisa?"</p>

<p>"But what about the pennies?" said auntie, laughing.
"If you are a Frantisker, Baby, you won't
have any pennies, and you said just now you wanted
a great lot of pennies."</p>

<p>Baby looked very grave.</p>

<p>"Then him won't be a Frantisker," he said decidedly.</p>

<p>After that he spoke very little all the way home.
He had a great deal on his mind, you see. And his
last thought that night as he was falling asleep was,
"Him are so glad him asked the little pitty girl to
take care of the shiny jugs."</p>

<p>Funny little Herr Baby! How much was fancy,
how much was earnest in his busy baby mind, who
can tell?</p>

<p>A few days after this, they all moved from the
Hotel to the pretty house with a garden which auntie
had gone to ask about. It <i>was</i> a pretty house. I
wish I could show it to you, children! It had not
only a garden but a terrace, and this terrace overlooked
the sea, the blue sunny sea of the south. And
from one side, or from a little farther down in the
garden, one could see the white-capped mountains,
rising, rising up into the sky, with sometimes a soft
mist about their heads which made them seem even
higher than they were, "high enough to peep into
heaven," said Baby; and sometimes, on very clear
days, standing out sharply against the blue behind,
so that one could hardly believe it would take more
than a few minutes to run to the top and down again.</p>

<p>There were many interesting things in this garden&mdash;things
that the children had not had in the old
garden at home, nice though it was. It was not so
beautifully neat as the flower part of the garden at
home, but I do not think the children liked it any the
less for that. The trees and bushes grew so thickly
that down at the lower end it was really like a wilderness,
a most lovely place for hide-and-seek. Then
there was a fountain, a real fountain, where the water
actually danced and fell all day long; and all round
the windows of the house and the trellised balcony
there were the most lovely red shaded leaves, such as
one never sees in such quantities in the north. And in
among the stones of the terrace there lived lizards&mdash;the
most delightful lizards. One in particular grew
so friendly that he used to come out at meal-times to
drink a little milk which the children spilt for him on
purpose; for the day nursery, or school-room, as Celia
liked it to be called, opened on to the terrace too,
though at the other end from the two drawing-rooms
and grandfather's "study," and the windows were long
and low, opening like doors, so that Lisa had hard
work to keep the children quiet at table the first few
days, for every minute they were jumping up to see
some new wonder that they caught sight of. Altogether
it was a very pretty home to spend the winter
in, and every one seemed very happy. Bully and the
"calanies" were as merry as larks, if it is true that
larks are merrier than other birds, and Peepy-Snoozle
and Tim, mistaking the bright warm sunshine for
another summer, I suppose, got in the habit of being
quite lively about the middle of the day as well as in
the middle of the night, instead of spending all the
daylight hours curled up like two very sleepy fairy
babies with brown fur coats on, in their nice white
cotton-wool nests.</p>

<p>There was so much to do and to think of the first
few days that I think Baby forgot a little about what
he had seen in the old curiosity shop. Auntie, too,
was too busy to give any thought to the picture which
had so taken her fancy, though neither she nor Baby
<i>really</i> forgot the dear little face with its loving, half-merry,
half-sad blue eyes. But auntie had to help
mother to get everything settled; and of course there
was a good deal to explain to the strange servants, for
neither Peters nor Linley the maid knew "lubbish
talk," as Baby <i>would</i> call it, at all, and it was very
funny indeed to hear Peters trying to make the
cook understand how grandfather liked his cutlets,
or Linley "pounding" at the housemaid, as Fritz
called it, to get it into her head that <i>she</i> didn't call it
<i>cleaning</i> a room to sweep all the dirt into a corner
where it couldn't be seen! Peters was more patient
than Linley. When Linley couldn't make herself
understood she used to shout louder and louder, as if
that would make the others know what she meant, and
then she used to say to Celia that it really was "a
<i>very</i> hodd thing that the people of this country seemed
not to have all their senses." And however Celia
explained to her, she <i>couldn't</i> be got to see that she
must seem just as stupid to them as they seemed
to her! Peters was less put about. He had been
in India with grandfather, so he said he was used
to "furriners." He seemed to think everybody that
wasn't English could be put together as "furriners";
but he had brought a dictionary and a book of little
sentences in four languages, and he would sit on the
kitchen table patiently trying one language after
another on the poor cook, just as when one can't
open a lock, one tries all the keys one can find, to
see if by chance one will fit. The cook was a very
mild, gentle man; he had a nice wife and two little
children in the town, and he was inclined to be very
fond of Herr Baby, and to pet him if ever he got a
chance. But that wasn't for a good while, for Baby
was at first terribly frightened of him. He had a
black moustache and whiskers and very black eyes,
and they looked blacker under his square white cook's
cap, and the first time Baby saw him through the
kitchen window, the cook happened to be standing
with a large carving-knife in one hand, and a chicken
which he was holding up by the legs, in the other.
Off flew Herr Baby. A little way down the garden he
ran against Denny, who was also busy examining
their new quarters.</p>

<p>"Oh, Denny, Denny!" he cried, "this is a dedful
place&mdash;there's a' ogre, a real tellable ogre in the house.
Him's seen him in one of the windows under the
dimey-room. Oh, Denny, Denny, p'raps him'll eaten
us up."</p>

<p>Denny for the first moment was, to tell the truth,
a little bit frightened herself. Common sense told
her there <i>were</i> no such things as ogres, not now-a-days
any way, at least not in England, their own country.
But a dreadful idea struck her that this was <i>not</i>
England; this might be one of the countries where
ogres, like wolves and bears, were still occasionally
to be found. There was no telling, certainly; but not
for a good deal would Miss Denise Aylmer, a young
lady of nine years old <i>past</i>, have owned to being
frightened as long as she could possibly help it.</p>

<p>She caught Baby by the hand.</p>

<p>"What sall we do?" he said; "sall we go and
tell mother?"</p>

<p>Denny considered.</p>

<p>"We'd better go and see again," she said very
bravely. "You must have made a mistake, I think,
Baby dear. I don't <i>think</i> there can be any ogres
here."</p>

<p>Baby was much struck by Denny's courage. His
hand slipped back a very little out of hers.</p>

<p>"Will <i>you</i> go and see, Denny?" he said. "Him
will stay here till you comes back."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you'd better come with me," said Denny,
who felt that even Baby was better than nobody. "I
shouldn't know where you saw the ogre," and she kept
tight hold of his hand. "Which window was it?"</p>

<p>"It were at a tiny window <i>really</i> under the
ground. Him was peeping to see if there was f'owers
'side of the wall," said Baby. "Him'll show you,
Denny; him <i>are</i> so glad you isn't f'ightened."</p>

<p>They set off down the path, making their way
rather cautiously as they got near the house.
Suddenly Denny felt Baby squeeze her hand more
tightly, and with a sort of scream he turned round
and hid his face against her.</p>

<p>"There! There!" he cried. "Him sees the
ogre coming."</p>

<p>Denny looked up. She saw a rather little man
with a white apron and a white cap, carrying a couple
of cackling hens or chickens in his arms, coming
across the garden from the house. He was on his
way to a little sort of poultry-yard, where he had
fastened up half-a-dozen live chickens he had bought
at the market that morning, meaning to kill two of
them for dinner, but finding them not so fat as he
had expected, he was putting them back among their
friends for a day or two. Very like a <i>real</i> ogre, if
Denny and Baby had understood all about it, which
they didn't. Denny herself, for a minute or two, felt
puzzled as to who this odd-looking man could be.
But he was no <i>ogre</i>, that was certain, any way.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Baby, it's not a' ogre," she
said. "Look up, he's far too little."</p>

<p>Baby ventured to peep round. The little black-eyed,
white-capped man came towards them smiling.</p>

<p>"Bon jour, Mademoiselle, bon jour, Monsieur
B&eacute;b&eacute;," he said, looking quite pleased. And then he
stroked down the ruffled feathers of the poor chickens,
and held them out to the two children, chattering
away at a great rate in Baby's "lubbish talk," hardly
a word of which they understood.</p>

<p>"Can he be wanting to sell the chickens?" said
Denny.</p>

<p>The cook, who had before this lived with families
from England, understood the children's language
better than they did his, which, however, is not saying
a great deal.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mees, pairfectly," he said. "Me sell zem
at ze march&eacute; the morning. Fine poulets, goot
poulets, not yet strong&mdash;wait one, two, 'ree days&mdash;be
strong for one grand dinner for Madame."</p>

<p>"Who are you? What's your name, please?"
said Denny, still a little alarmed.</p>

<p>"Jean-Georges, Mademoiselle," said the little
man, with a bow. "Jean-Georges compose charming
plates for Mademoiselle and Monsieur B&eacute;b&eacute;. Jean-Georges
loves little messieurs and little 'demoiselles.
Madame permit Monsieur and Mademoiselle visit
Jean-Georges in his cuisine one day."</p>

<p>Denny caught the word "cuisine," which, of
course, children, you will know means "kitchen."</p>

<p>"He's the cook, Baby," she said, with great relief;
"don't you remember grandfather said he must have
a man cook? Good morning, Mr. Cook, we'll ask
mother to let us go and see you one day in your
kitchen, and you must make us very nice things to
eat, please Mr. Cook."</p>

<p>"Pairfectly, Mademoiselle," said Jean-Georges,
with as magnificent a bow as he could manage, considering
the two chickens in his arms, and then he
walked away.</p>

<p>"What a <i>very</i> nice man!" said Denny, feeling very
proud of herself, and quite forgetting that she, too,
had not been without some fears. "You see, Baby
dear, how foolish it is to be frightened. I <i>told</i> you
there couldn't be any ogres here."</p>

<p>Herr Baby did not answer for a moment. He had
certainly very much admired Denny's courage, but
still he wasn't quite sure that she had not been a <i>very</i>
little afraid, just for a minute, when he had called out
"There he is!"</p>

<p>"What would you have done if there <i>had</i> been a'
ogre, Denny?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother," said Denny, "what's the good of
talking about things that <i>couldn't</i> be? Talk of something
sensible, Baby."</p>

<p>Baby grew silent again. They walked on slowly
down the garden path.</p>

<p>"Denny," said Baby, in a minute or two, "didn't
the little man say somefin about mother having a
party?"</p>

<p>Denny pricked up her ears at this. Parties of all
kinds pleased her very much.</p>

<p>"Did he?" she said, "I didn't notice. He said
something about Madame's dinner, but I didn't think
he meant a dinner-<i>party</i>. Perhaps he did though.
We'll ask. I'd like mother to have some parties; it
seems quite a long time since I had one of my best
frocks on to come down to the drawing-room before
dinner, the way we did at home. And I know mother
and auntie have friends here. I heard that stupid
little footman asking Linley what day 'Miladi' would
'receive,' that means have visitors, Baby."</p>

<p>Denny's tongue had run on so fast, that it had left
Baby's wits some way behind. They had stopped
short at the first idea of a party.</p>

<p>"Mother likes to make <i>werry</i> pitty dinners when
she has parties," he said. "Mother told him that
were why she were so solly when him breaked her's
pitty glasses."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about, Baby,"
said Denny. "Let's have a race. I'll give you a
start."</p>

<p>There was a cat at the Villa D&eacute;sir&eacute;e, Baby's, and
Denny's, and "all of them's house," as Baby would
have called it. Where the cat came from I don't
know&mdash;whether it belonged to the villa and let itself
out with it every winter, like the furniture, or whether
it was really the cat of Madame Jean-Georges, and
had followed Monsieur Jean-Georges back one evening
when he had been home to see his "good friend"
(that was what he called his wife), and his two "b&eacute;b&eacute;s,"
is what I cannot tell. I only know the cat was there,
and that when Baby could get a chance of playing
with it he was very pleased. He didn't often have a
chance, in his own room, for "Mademoiselle," as Celia
was always called by the new servants, a title which
she thought much nicer than "Miss Aylmer," or
"Miss Celia," <i>Mademoiselle</i>, said "the stupid little
footman," had given strict orders that "Minet" was
not to be allowed upstairs for fear of the "pets," the
"calanies," and the Bully, and Peepy-Snoozle, and
Tim, all of whom would have been very much to
Minet's taste, I fear. It was very funny to see the
way the little footman went "shoo-ing" at the poor
cat the moment Celia appeared, for Celia had rather
grand manners for her age, and the servants thought
her very "distinguished," especially the stupid little
footman. But Herr Baby was very sorry for poor
Minet; he had no particular pet of his own here,
nothing to make up for his "labbits," and so he took
a great fancy to the pussy.</p>

<p>"Poor little 'weet darling," he would call it;
"Celia's a c'uel girl to d'ive Minet away, <i>Minet</i>
wouldn't hurt the calanies, or the Bully, or the sleepy-mouses;
Minet is far too good."</p>

<p>"Pray, how do <i>you</i> know, Baby?" Celia would
say. "Cats are cats all the world over, every one
knows that."</p>

<p>"<i>Minet</i> aren't," Baby would have it, "Minet has
suts a kind heart. Him asked Minet if her would
hurt the calanies and the sleepy-mouses, and her said
'no, sairtingly not.'"</p>

<p>"Baby!" said Denny, "what stories! Cats can't
talk. You shouldn't tell stories."</p>

<p>"Minet can talk," said Baby. "When him asks
for somefin, her says 'proo-proo-oo,' and that means
'yes,' and if her means 'no,' her humps up her back
and s'akes her tail. When him asked Minet if her
would like to hurt the calanies, her humped up her
back <i>never</i> so high, and sook and <i>sook</i> her tail, for no,
<i>no</i>, <span class="smallcaps">NO</span>!"</p>

<p>Celia could not find an answer to this. Baby went
on stroking Minet with great satisfaction, as if there
was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Celia at last, "I don't want
Minet to come upstairs. She's quite as happy downstairs,
and, you see, it would <i>frighten</i> the birds and
the dormice if they saw her, for <i>they</i> mightn't understand
that she wouldn't, on any account, hurt them."</p>

<p>"Werry well," said Baby, and he went on playing
with his new pet.</p>

<p>"Herr Baby," said Lisa coming into the room a
moment or two later; "mine child, how is it that
your coat is so dirty? All green, Herr Baby, as if
you had rubbed it on the wet grass."</p>

<p>"It's with his poking in among the bushes by the
kitchen window," said Denny of the ready tongue;
"yesterday, you know, Baby, when you thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Baby, "don't talk to me. You distairb
me and the cat&mdash;we'se busy."</p>

<p>Denny and Lisa looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>"Pussy, pitty pussy, dear Minet," went on Baby,
who wanted to stop Denny's account of his fears.</p>

<p>"We're going out, Herr Baby," said Lisa. "There
are commissions for your lady mamma. We are to
go to the patissier and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are the pattyser?" said Baby.</p>

<p>"The cumfectioner," said Denny.</p>

<p>Baby pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"We are to go to the patissier," said Lisa, "to
order some cakes for Miladi for to-morrow, when
Miladi's friends come to dine; and perhaps we will
buy some little cake for Herr Baby's tea. Come,
mine child, leave Minet, and come."</p>

<p>Herr Baby got up from the corner of the room
where he had been embracing the cat; there was a
grave look on his face, but he did not say anything
till he was out on the road with Lisa. Denny was
not with them; she had got leave to go a walk with
Celia and the lady who came every day to give her
French lessons, which Denny thought much more
grand than going out with Baby and Lisa.</p>

<p>"Lisa," said Baby, after a few minutes, "are
mother going to have a party?"</p>

<p>"Not one very big party," said Lisa, "just some
Miladis and some Herren&mdash;some genkelmen&mdash;to
dine."</p>

<p>"Will it look very pitty?" asked Baby.</p>

<p>"Not so pretty as at <i>home</i>," said Lisa, who, now
that she was away from it, of course looked upon The
Manor&mdash;that was the name of "home"&mdash;as the most
lovely place in the world; "there's no nice glass, no
nice pretty dishes here. And Fran&ccedil;ois, he is so
dumm&mdash;how you say 'dumm,' Herr Baby?"</p>

<p>"Dumm," repeated Baby, exactly copying Lisa's
voice, staring up in her face.</p>

<p>"No, mine child, how you say it of English?
Ah&mdash;I knows&mdash;<i>stupid</i>. Fran&ccedil;ois, he is too stupid.
Peters and I, we will make the table so pretty as
might be. Lisa will command some bon-bons."</p>

<p>"Mother will want the shiny jugs," thought poor
Baby. "Him <i>s'ould</i> have brought him's pennies.
Him would like to know if him has 'nuff pennies;
perhaps him could go to the little girl's shop when
Lisa is at the pattyser's."</p>

<p>But he said nothing aloud. How it was that he
kept his thoughts to himself, why he had such a dislike
to any one knowing what was in his mind, I
cannot exactly tell; but so it was, and so it often is
with very little children, even though quite frank
and open by nature. Baby had, I think, a fear that
mother might not like him to spend all his pennies
on the shiny jugs, perhaps she might say she would
pay them herself, and that would not have pleased
him at all. Deep down in his honest little heart was
the feeling that <i>he</i> had broken the glasses and <i>he</i>
should pay for the new ones. But he said nothing to
Lisa&mdash;he had never spoken of the jugs to her&mdash;mother
had been "so kind," never to tell any one about what
a silly little boy he had been, for mother knew that
he didn't like being laughed at. <i>Perhaps</i> "they"
would laugh at him now if he told about wanting to
buy the shiny jugs&mdash;he wouldn't mind so much if he
<i>had</i> bought them, but "'appose they wouldn't let him
go to the shop to get them?" Poor little mother!
She wouldn't have her pitty glasses then for the party&mdash;no,
it was much best to settle it all his own self.
Whom he meant by "they" I don't think Baby quite
knew, he had a sort of picture in his mind of grandfather
and auntie and mother all talking together, and
Celia and Fritz and Denny all joining in, and saying
that "Baby was far too little to go to shops to buy
things." And by the time he had thought this all
over, Herr Baby glancing up&mdash;for till now he had
been walking along with Lisa's hand, seeing and
noticing nothing&mdash;found that they were already in
the street of the town where the biggest shops were,
and that Lisa was looking about to find the shop
where she was to give the orders for his mother.</p>

<p>It was a very pretty shop indeed&mdash;Baby had never
seen such a pretty shop. The cakes and bon-bons
were laid out so nicely on the tables round the wall,
and they were all of such pretty colours. Baby
walked round and round admiring, and, I think, considering
he was such a very little boy, that it was
very good of him not to think of touching any of the
tempting dainties. In a few minutes Lisa had
ordered all she wanted&mdash;then she chose some nice
biscuits and a very few little chocolate bon-bons, which
she had put up in two paper parcels, and when they
came out of the shop she told Herr Baby that they
were for him, his mother had told her to get him
something nice. Baby looked pleased, but still he
seemed very grave, and Lisa began wondering what
he was thinking of.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, mine child?" she said.</p>

<p>No, Herr Baby was not at all tired. He wanted
to walk down the street to the other end to see all the
shops, he wanted to see <i>all</i> the streets and <i>all</i> the
shops before they went home. Lisa was rather
amused. She had not known Herr Baby was so
<i>very</i> fond of shops, she said, and it would take far too
long to see them <i>all</i>. But she went to the end of that
street with him, and then back again down the opposite
side, and then he begged her to turn down the
other street they had crossed on their way to the confectioner's,
and they had gone quite to the end of <i>it</i>,
Baby staring in at all the shop windows in a way that
really made Lisa smile, for he looked so grave and
solemn, when all of a sudden, just as Lisa was thinking
of saying they must go home, Baby gave a sort
of little scream and almost jumped across the street.</p>

<p>"Him sees it, him sees it," he cried, and when
Lisa asked him what he meant, all he would say
was,</p>

<p>"That's the little street we went down with auntie
the 'nother day," and Lisa, who had forgotten all about
the old shop window with the shiny glass and the
blue-eyed picture, wondered why he was so eager
about it.</p>

<p>"Is that the way we came?" she said, "I am not
sure. I not quite remember."</p>

<p>But "him wants to go home that way," persisted
Baby, and he tugged Lisa along. They passed at the
other side, but Baby did not mind that. He could
see across quite plainly, for the street was narrow,
and there were still the glasses in the corner and the
sweet baby-girl face up on the wall, looking down
on them.</p>

<p>And after that he was quite satisfied to go quietly
home; he did not speak much on the way, but Lisa
was accustomed to his grave fits, and did not pay
much attention to them. He only asked her one
question&mdash;just as they were getting close to the
Villa.</p>

<p>"Is it to-morrow mother's going to have all the
pitty things for dinner?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Herr Baby, and Lisa will be busy, to show
Fran&ccedil;ois how Miladi likes everything. Herr Baby
and Fr&auml;ulein Denny will be goot and play peacefully
in the garden to-morrow, so she can be busy," said
Lisa, who was very proud of being of so much consequence.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Herr Baby, "him won't want you to
take care of him."</p>

<p>After tea he got out his money-box. This he
often did. He was such a careful little boy that
mother let him keep his money himself, and it was a
great pleasure to him to count over the different kinds
of "pennies;" he called them all "pennies," brown,
white, and even yellow pennies, for Baby had a pound
and a ten shilling piece that had been given him on
his last birthday, and that he had never been able to
make up his mind how to spend. He looked at them
now with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"See, Denny," he said, "him has two yellow
pennies, a big and a little, and free white pennies, a
big and a little and a littler, and five brown pennies.
Him knows there's five, for him can count up to five,
'cos five's just as old as him is going to be. See,
Denny, isn't there a lot? And the yellow pennies
could be turned into lots and lots of white pennies
Lisa says, and the white pennies could be turned into
lots of brown pennies, isn't it funny? Isn't him
werry rich, Denny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," said Denny, "I really don't
know. I wish you wouldn't chatter so, Baby. I
can't learn my lessons."</p>

<p>Poor Baby! It was not often he was to blame for
"chattering so." But he looked with great respect at
Denny for having lessons to do, and was not at all
offended. Denny was proud of being with Celia and
the new governess, but I think her pleasure was a
little spoilt by finding that the new governess had no
idea of taking care of a little girl who didn't do any
lessons, and this evening she was rather cross at a
row of French words which she had to learn to say
the next morning. Baby went quietly off into the
corner with his money-box, but finding it rather dull
to have no one to show his pennies to, he went out of
the room, which you remember was downstairs, and,
opening a door which led to the kitchen, peeped about
in hopes of seeing his friend Minet. He had not
long to wait&mdash;Minet had a corner of her own by the
kitchen wall, on the other side of which was the stove,
and where she found herself almost as warm as in the
kitchen, when Monsieur Jean-Georges objected to her
company. She was curled up in this corner when
she heard Baby's soft voice calling her&mdash;"Minet,
Minet, pussy, pussy," and up she got, slowly and
lazily, as cats do when they are half asleep, but still
willingly enough, for she dearly loved Herr Baby.</p>

<p>"Minet," said Baby, when she appeared, and
coming up to him rubbed her furry coat against his
little bare legs, "Minet, dear, come and sit wif him
on the 'teps going down to the garden, and him'll tell
you about his money."</p>

<p>But Lisa, coming by just then, said it was too
cold now to sit on stone steps; for warm as it was in
the day at Santino the evenings got quickly chilly.</p>

<p>"Us can't go back to the 'coolroom," said Baby;
"Denny won't let dear Minet come there, and him
must stay wif Minet, 'cos her waked up when him
called her."</p>

<p>"Miss Denny must let you stay in the school-room,"
said Lisa. "There is no little birds there for
Minet to touch."</p>

<p>She opened the door, and Denny was too busy
with her lessons to scold.</p>

<p>"You will be very quiet, Herr Baby," said Lisa.
So Baby and Minet went off into a corner with the
money-box.</p>

<p>"Minet, dear," said Baby, in a low voice, "see
what lots of pennies him has. Yellow pennies, and
white pennies, and brown pennies."</p>

<p>Minet purred, naturally, for Baby was stroking
her softly with one hand all the time he was holding
up his pennies with the other.</p>

<p>"Dear Minet," said Baby, much gratified, "you is
pleased that him has so many pennies. Now, Minet,
him will tell you a secret, a <i>gate, gate</i> secret, about
what him's going to do wif all him's pennies."</p>

<p>Here Minet purred again. Baby looked round.
There was no one listening. Lisa was going backwards
and forwards, putting away the tea-things;
Denny was still groaning and grumbling over her row
of words; Baby might safely tell Minet his secret.
Still he lowered his voice <i>so</i> low that certainly no one
but Minet could hear. And when he left off speaking,
Minet purred more than ever. Only Baby thought it
just as well to say to her, before Lisa took him away
up to bed, "Minet, dear, you'll be <i>sure</i> not to tell
nobody;" and I suppose Minet promised, for Baby
seemed quite pleased.</p>

<p>He woke in the morning with his head quite full
of his great idea. They were not to go a regular walk
that day, Lisa told him, for in the afternoon she would
be busy, and Herr Baby would be good and play
quietly in the garden, would he not?</p>

<p>"All alone?" asked Baby.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Denny will stay, too, if Herr Baby
wishes," said Lisa; "she was going again with Miss
Celia, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Baby, "him would rather be alone,
kite alone, 'cept Minet. Fritz is very good to him,
but Fritz will be at school. Fritz is never at home
now 'cept Thursdays."</p>

<p>"No," said Lisa; "but Herr Fritz is very happy
at school, and when Herr Baby is big he will go
too."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby; but he didn't seem to think
much what he was saying. Lisa thought he was dull
about Fritz being at school&mdash;I forgot to tell you that
Fritz went every day now to a very nice school in the
town, where there were a few boys about his own age&mdash;but
Lisa was mistaken.</p>

<p>That afternoon, any one passing the low hedge
which at one side was all that divided the Villa garden
from the road, would have seen a pretty little picture.
There was Baby, seated on the grass, one arm fondly
clasping Minet's neck, while with the other he firmly
held the famous money-box. He was dressed in his
garden blouse only, but for some reason he had his
best hat on. And he kept looking about him, first
towards the house and then towards the garden gate,
in a funny considering sort of way.</p>

<p>At last he seemed to have made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Minet," he said to the cat, "him thinks we'll go
now. 'Amember, Minet, you've <i>p'omised</i> to go wif
him. If you get werry tired, Minet, him'll try to carry
you. If you could carry the money-box, and him
could carry you, then it would be <i>kite</i> easy. What
a pity you haven't got two more paws, that would
do for hands, Minet!"</p>

<p>Minet purred.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor Minet. Nebber mind, dear; but we
must be going." And closely followed by the cat,
who had no idea, poor thing, of what was before her,
Baby made his way down the path to the garden
gate. It was open, at least not latched. Baby easily
pushed it wide enough for his little self to go through,
and stood, with Minet and the money-box, triumphant
on the highroad.</p>

<p>"It were the best way, thit way," he said to himself.
For there was another gate to the Villa, leading
out to the upper road. But this gate was guarded by
a lodge, and the "concierge," as they called the
lodge-keeper, came out to open it for every one who
went in and out. And "p'raps," thought Baby, "the
concierge mightn't have let him through, 'cos, of
course, her didn't know why him was going out
alone with Minet."</p>

<p>So Minet and he and the money-box found themselves
out on the road on their own account.</p>

<p>All the family was scattered that afternoon. Celia
and Denny had gone a long walk with their governess,
Fritz was at school, mother and auntie had
driven to see some friends a good way off, meaning
to call for Fritz at his school on their way home.
The servants, too, were all more busy than usual on
account of the ladies and gentlemen coming to dinner.
Lisa and Linley and Peters were all trying to make
the strange servants understand just how they were
used to have the table at home, and giving themselves
a great deal more trouble than grandfather or
mother would have wished had they known about it.
Lisa was very clever at arranging flowers prettily,
and she was so sure of Baby's quiet ways when he
was left to himself, that she never gave a thought to
him once she saw him safely settled in the garden
with Minet. It was such a safe garden. There
really was no part of it where a child could get into
any trouble, for though there was a little water in the
basin from which rose the fountain, it was so little,
that not even Minet could have wetted much more
than her paws in it. So Lisa went on quite comfortably
doing the flowers and arranging the dessert in
the pantry, by way of giving Fran&ccedil;ois a lesson, and
now and then she would glance out of the window
which looked on to the garden, and, seeing Baby
there with Minet, she felt quite easy. She did once
say to herself,</p>

<p>"I wonder why Herr Baby begged so to have his
best hat to-day&mdash;but he is one good child, one should
please him sometimes."</p>

<p>I am afraid the truth was that Lisa spoilt her
dear Baby a little!</p>

<p>After a while she looked out again. She did not
see Herr Baby this time, but she did not think anything
of it.</p>

<p>"They will have gone to play among the bushes,"
she said to herself, meaning by "they" Baby and
Minet of course, and she went on with what she was
doing, and got so interested in helping Peters to
explain to Fran&ccedil;ois that in England people always
changed the wine glasses at the end of dinner, and
put clean ones for dessert, that the time went on
without it ever entering her head to say to herself,
"What can have become of Herr Baby?"</p>

<p>Mother and auntie were later than they had expected
of returning from their drive. They had gone
a long way, and coming back it was mostly up-hill.</p>

<p>"Fritz will be thinking we have forgotten him,"
said mother, looking at her watch, "but I told him to
be sure to wait till we came. He is too little to go
home alone yet, at least till he knows his way quite
well or can speak enough to ask."</p>

<p>"We might have told Celia and Denny to call
for him, as they are out with Mademoiselle," said
auntie.</p>

<p>Just then in turning a corner, for they were quite
in the town now, auntie's eyes caught sight of the
narrow street where the old curiosity shop was.</p>

<p>"By the by," she said, "I should so like to ask
about that picture. I told you about it, you remember,
May?"&mdash;May, you know, was the children's
mother's name&mdash;"have we time to go that way?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not; we are late already," said mother.
"I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, another day will do quite well,"
said auntie, cheerfully.</p>

<p>So they drove home, quickly, just stopping a
moment to pick up Fritz, who was waiting for them
at the gate of his school.</p>

<p>If they <i>had</i> happened to go round by the old
curiosity shop, how surprised they would have been;
but what a great deal of trouble it would have saved
them, as you shall hear.</p>

<p>Lisa met them as they got home, with a long story
about the table and the flowers and the stupidness of
Fran&ccedil;ois, which mother and auntie could hardly help
laughing at.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Lisa," said mother; "it will do
very well, I am sure. Where are the children?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs, Miladi, taking off their things. They
have just come in," said Lisa, never thinking, somehow,
as mother said the "children," but that she was talking
of Celia and Denny. For, somehow, in this family&mdash;in
every family there are little habits of the kind&mdash;Baby
was not often spoken of among "the children."
They had all got so used to the name of Herr Baby,
which Lisa had called him by since he was quite a
wee baby, that he was seldom spoken of by any other,
and often Baby himself would talk gravely about "the
children," without any one seeming to think it odd.</p>

<p>"Upstairs, are they?" said mother. "Well, run
off, Fritz, dear, and try and get some of your lessons
done before tea. Mademoiselle will help you a little,
I daresay, before she goes."</p>

<p>Off ran Fritz. He was a very good boy about his
lessons, and anxious to get on well. More to please
Lisa and the others than that they cared, mother and
auntie went into the dining-room. They were standing
looking at the pretty flowers and leaves, when
suddenly Fritz put his head in at the door again.</p>

<p>"Lisa," he said, "where's Baby? He's not upstairs,
and he's not in the garden. Linley said you
told him to play there this afternoon, but he's <i>not</i>
there."</p>

<p>Lisa started, and her face grew white.</p>

<p>"Mine child!" she cried. "Ah, but he must be in
the garden, Master Fritz! I saw him there so happy,
with the cat, just&mdash;ah, how long ago was it? Have I
forgotten him for so long? He must be hiding&mdash;to
play, to&mdash;how do you say?" for Lisa's English was
very apt to fly away when she got frightened or upset.
"Ach, where can he be?" and off darted poor Lisa.</p>

<p>Mother and auntie and Fritz looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Can he be <i>lost</i>?" said Fritz, with a very frightened
face.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no," said auntie. "Lisa is so easily
startled. But still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us all go and look for him at once," said
mother. "What a good thing poor grandfather isn't
back yet!"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a good thing grandfather was out, for&mdash;and
this was what mother was thinking of&mdash;poor grandfather,
though he looked such a fine, tall, gray-haired
old gentleman, was not really very strong or well.
It was a great deal for him that they had all come
abroad this winter, and the doctors had told mother
and auntie that anything to startle or distress him
might make him very ill indeed. Poor grandfather!
I can't tell you what a kind, good man he was. He
had stayed a great many years in India, though he
would have liked dreadfully to come home, because it
was "his duty" he said, and this had made him seem
older than he really was, for a hot country is very
wearing out to people who are not born to it. And,
though he was so fond of his grandchildren, I think
if he <i>had</i> a pet among them, it was little Herr Baby.
The mere idea of his tiny Raymond&mdash;Baby was
named Raymond after grandfather&mdash;being lost, even
for an hour or two, would have troubled him dreadfully,
and thinking of this, auntie, too, repeated after
mother,</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, what a good thing grandfather isn't
in. We <i>mustn't</i> let him know, May, till Baby's found."</p>

<p>They didn't stay to say anything more. Off they
all set into the garden, for, though Fritz said he had
looked all over, they couldn't feel sure that they might
not find Baby in some corner, hiding, perhaps, for
fun, even. But when they had all been round and
round the garden in every direction&mdash;mother, and
auntie, and Celia, and Denny, and Fritz, and Mademoiselle
Lucie, and Lisa, and Linley, and Peters, and
Fran&ccedil;ois, and, even at the end I believe, Monsieur
Jean-Georges himself, and the rest of the French
servants&mdash;when they had all looked, and peeped, and
shouted, and whistled, and begged, and prayed Baby
to come out if he was hiding, and there was no
answer, then they gave it up. It was impossible
that the little man could be in the garden.</p>

<p>Where could he be?</p>

<p>Fortunately there was nowhere in the garden
where he could have hurt himself&mdash;no pit or pond
into which he could have fallen. And it was surely
impossible that any one could have come into the
garden and stolen him away, as Celia, with a pale
face, whispered to auntie. Where could he be, and
what should they do?</p>

<p>Time was passing&mdash;the friends who were coming
to dinner would be at the villa before long; grandfather
was <i>sure</i> to appear in a few minutes. What
could they do?</p>

<p>"We must not tell grandfather, that is certain,"
said auntie. "May, dear, it is very hard on you, I
know, but I'll tell you how it must be. You must
stay here quietly and be ready for the friends who are
coming, and I will go off at once and do all, everything
I can think of. Mademoiselle Lucie, you know
the town, and you can tell me all about the police,
and where to go to <i>in case</i> we don't find our darling
at once, though I quite think we shall. I can't take
you, Peters," for Peters was eagerly coming forward,
"Sir Raymond would miss you, nor you, Lisa, for
you must take care of the other children," at which
Lisa all but broke out crying; "It was too good of
Mademoiselle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne to trust her; she didn't deserve
it." "And Fran&ccedil;ois would be no good. You and I,
Mademoiselle Lucie, will go at once. And you must
tell grandfather that I was obliged to go out, for an
hour or two, unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will think it very strange," said
mother, "but I will do my best."</p>

<p>Mother spoke quietly, but her face was very white.</p>

<p>"Do go, Nelly," she said, "as quick as you can."</p>

<p>And Celia and Denny, who had been thinking of
bursting into tears, took example by her and auntie,
and tried to look cheerful.</p>

<p>"Auntie," said Celia, running after her to the
gate, "I'll be very good and try to comfort mother.
And we'll not let grandfather think there's anything
wrong. But oh, auntie dear, I <i>hope</i> you'll soon bring
dear Baby safe home."</p>

<p>"So do I, darling," said auntie, stooping to kiss
her, even though she was so hurried, and, for the first
time, there was a little quiver in her voice, and Celia
ran back to the others, thinking even more than
before how good and brave auntie was.</p>

<p>They hastened down the road, auntie and little
Mademoiselle Lucie, I mean. But when they had
gone some little way, auntie stopped short.</p>

<p>"He may have gone by the other road, and we
may miss him that way;" for, without thinking,
auntie had hurried out by the little gate opening on
to the lower road.</p>

<p>"I think not," said Mademoiselle Lucie, "at least
the concierge would have been sure to see him, and
we did ask her, and she had not seen him at all."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said auntie, "I forgot about the
concierge."</p>

<p>"Besides," Mademoiselle Lucie continued, "to get
to the town he must pass the way we are going, a
little farther on where the two roads run together."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said auntie, again.</p>

<p>"It is to the town we are going?" asked Mademoiselle
Lucie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said auntie, "I have an idea, but I did
not like to say it to my sister for fear it should lead
to nothing. There is a shop in the town where there
is a picture that Baby took a great fancy to the other
day. At least it was I that noticed it first, and he
was so pleased with it. There was something else in
the shop that he was looking at&mdash;I don't remember
what&mdash;when we noticed the picture."</p>

<p>"Do you know where the shop is? Can we
easily find it?"</p>

<p>"I think so; yes, I am sure I can find it," said
auntie. "It is a shop of curiosities, a shop at a corner,
the street is narrow."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Mademoiselle Lucie, "though it
is not very well known. There are grander shops
of curiosities which are more visited, but I know that
shop, as I often pass it."</p>

<p>She told auntie the name of the owner of the
shop, and of the street, and then auntie fixed, as they
were now near the town, that she would go on alone
to the shop, while Mademoiselle Lucie went to her
brother, who, she hoped, would be at home at this
hour, and get him to go with her to the police office,
so that no time should be lost.</p>

<p>Auntie hurried on by herself, but though she went
so fast that the easy-going peasants driving their
sleepy bullocks, whom she met, looked after her in
surprise, she did not, for one moment, leave off looking
about her on every side, to see if by any chance
she could discover the well-known little figure it
would have given her such joy to see. But no. Once
or twice a child in the distance made her heart beat a
little quicker, but, as soon as she got near enough to
see it clearly, her hopes sank again. There were very
few houses on the country road leading from the villa
till one was quite in the town. So auntie thought it
not worth while to ask, for, in a street of houses and
shops standing close together, and people constantly
passing, it was much less likely that any one would
have noticed a little tot like Herr Baby making his
way.</p>

<p>"No," said auntie to herself, "it is no use stopping
to ask. The best thing I can do is to find the shop
at once, and if they can tell me nothing there, to
follow Mademoiselle Lucie to the police office."</p>

<p>And, with a deep sigh, for, somehow, every step
she took farther without seeing anything of the little
truant, made auntie's heart feel heavier&mdash;she hurried
on again.</p>

<p>She soon found the wide street&mdash;the street with
the dressmakers' and milliners' shops, which Fritz
had not cared to look at&mdash;then she turned one corner
and went on a little farther, then another, and&mdash;yes,
there was the little old shop, looking just the same as
the day they had all stood there so happily. Auntie
had been walking very quickly, almost running, but
when she saw the shop just before her she stood still&mdash;she
felt <i>so</i> anxious&mdash;what should she do if she
could hear nothing of Baby?</p>

<p>When she got to the door she stopped and looked
in; there seemed to be no one in the shop. Auntie
glanced up to the side of the door where the little
portrait had hung. It was gone! Could that have
anything to do with Baby? auntie asked herself in
a sort of puzzled way. Could Baby have thought
of buying it? how much money had he? But it
was stupid and foolish to stand there puzzling and
wondering, instead of boldly going in to ask. Auntie
took her courage in her two hands, as the saying is,
and went in.</p>

<p>No one there; where could the owner of the shop
be? The last time he had come forward at once
when they were only looking in&mdash;a little-dried up old
man, just the sort of person one would expect to find
in such a shop, sitting in a dark corner like an old
spider, watching to see what flies were passing his
way. Auntie went right in without seeing any one,
but she heard voices not far off, and, in her anxiety,
she went forward to a door slightly open, leading into
rooms behind the shop. She knocked&mdash;but for a
moment no one took any notice. They were talking
so eagerly inside that she had to knock again, and in
the moment or two that had passed without them
hearing her, she heard one or two words that made
her eager to hear more.</p>

<p>"No, no," some one was saying, "much better go
at once to the office. We may get into trouble."</p>

<p>"He seems so sensible," said another voice. "<i>I</i>
say, better go with him and carry the things, and we
shall soon see if he knows his way, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Auntie <i>could</i> not wait any more. She pushed
open the door and went in. There was, however, no
Herr Baby to be seen, as she had almost expected
there would be. There was the old man that she
remembered having seen before, looking like a very
startled spider this time, as he raised his two
shrivelled old arms in surprise at her appearance, and
beside him was a very pleasant, bright-faced, young
woman, with a baby in her arms, talking, or at least
looking as if she had just been talking very eagerly.</p>

<p>"Is he here?" said auntie, quite breathless, "my
little boy, my little nephew, I mean. Is Baby here?"</p>

<p>The young woman looked at the old man with a
sort of little nod of triumph.</p>

<p>"You see," she said quickly, "I said there was no
need to frighten the poor darling by taking him to the
police office." "Yes, Madame," she went on, turning
to auntie, "the dear b&eacute;b&eacute; is here&mdash;that is to say, he
cannot but be the one you are looking for. I sent
him out into the little garden with his cat and my
little girl, while my grandfather and I talked about
what to do. I would have sent him home, I mean
we would have tried to find his home, if my husband
had been here, but he is away."</p>

<p>"And I am too feeble, Madame, as you see, to
walk far," said the old man, who seemed now anxious
to be very amiable.</p>

<p>"But you talked of taking him to the police
office," said the young woman, in a low voice, "the
idea! to frighten a b&eacute;b&eacute; like that."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," said the old man, "all was to be
done for the best. You shall see him, your dear
child, Madame," he went on, bustling about.</p>

<p>"But tell me first&mdash;a moment&mdash;&mdash;" said auntie,
"What did he come for? Did he buy the picture?"</p>

<p>"The picture," repeated the old man, "no, surely.
It was the glass jugs, the little gentleman wanted,
and he had his money all right&mdash;I took but the just
price, Madame&mdash;I would not deceive any one."</p>

<p>"They are very dear to <i>my</i> mind," said the young
woman, "but there&mdash;I know nothing about old
things. This is not our shop, Madame&mdash;I look in
in passing, to see the grandfather sometimes, that
is all."</p>

<p>"And Baby came to buy some <i>jugs</i>, you say,"
repeated auntie. There was a confused remembrance
in her mind of something Baby had said about jugs,
something he had asked her to look at the day they
had stood at the shop window, but which she had
since forgotten. Her only idea in coming to the little
old shop had been the picture. "You said he came
to buy some jugs?" she said again.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame," said the old man "two glass jugs&mdash;Venetian
glass."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said auntie, and then she remembered it
all&mdash;about the glass jugs that Baby had broken at
home, and what he had said to her about those in the
shop window being like them. "And the picture?"
she said, "is it no longer there? But first, let me
have my little boy. He is in the garden, you say?"</p>

<p>She looked round, for there was no sign of a
garden. The window of the little room in which they
were, looked out only on to a blank wall.</p>

<p>"This way, Madame," said the young woman,
opening a door at the side. It led into a little dark
passage, and, at the end of it, there was another door,
standing open, and through this door came the sound
of children's voices.</p>

<p>Auntie stood still a moment to listen&mdash;the first
words made her smile.</p>

<p>"Him wants to go home now," said the well-known
voice. "Little girl, why <i>won't</i> you listen?
Him wants to go home, and so does Minet. Doesn't
you hear?"</p>

<p>The little girl must have been very much puzzled,
for auntie heard her trying her best, in her baby talk,
to make this queer little stranger understand that
they were to stay out in the garden till her mother
called them in.</p>

<p>"Him wants to go <i>home</i>, and so does Minet," repeated
poor Baby, and his voice began to quiver and
shake, as if he were going to cry. Auntie could stand
it no longer. She hurried out into the little garden.</p>

<p>"You shall go home now, Baby dear," she said.
"Auntie has come to fetch you."</p>

<p>Baby looked up eagerly at the sound of a well-known
voice. He ran to her and held up his little
face for a kiss. He looked very pleased, but not at
all surprised. It was one of Herr Baby's funny ways,
that he almost never seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"Him is so glad you's come," he said. "You'll
help him to carry home the shiny jugs, for Minet's
<i>raver</i> tired, and him might have to carry her and the
money-box. But you won't tell mother about the
jugs, will you? You'll let him run in wif them
him's self, won't you, auntie? <i>Won't</i> mother be
pleased?"</p>

<p>"But you must tell me all about it, dear," said
auntie; "did you come off all alone to get the
glasses? Why didn't you ask some one to come
with you?"</p>

<p>Baby looked a little troubled.</p>

<p>"Him didn't come <i>alone</i>," he said. "Him told
Minet, and Minet comed too, only her's werry tired.
And it were for the party, auntie," he added, looking
up wistfully, "Lisa said mother had no pitty jugs for
her's party. And oh, auntie, p'ease do be kick, 'fear
we shall be too late."</p>

<p>Auntie took his hand and led him back into the
shop, where the old man was wrapping up the jugs
with a great show of soft paper, that auntie should
see how careful he was.</p>

<p>"Has my little boy paid you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Herr Baby, understanding, though
she did not speak English. "See in him's money-box;"
he held out the money-box with some difficulty
for, having Minet under the other arm, it was not
easy for him to get his hands free; "him had two
yellow pennies, one big and one little, him gived the
big one for the shiny jugs."</p>

<p>"Was that the price of the jugs?" auntie asked
the man.</p>

<p>"No, Madame, I have the change to give the little
gentleman. See here," and he held out two large
silver coins, the size of crowns, which auntie took.</p>

<p>"I don't think the jugs are dear," she said, with a
smile, turning to the young woman, who looked
pleased. "And some day," she went on, "we will
come to see you, and bring you some little thing for
your little girl, as you have been so kind to my little
boy. Come now, Baby dear, we must get home as
quick as we can."</p>

<p>"But the little girl, the pitty little girl," said Herr
Baby, "him must say good-bye to <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"There she is beside you," said auntie, thinking,
of course, that he meant the young woman's little girl,
"say good-bye to her."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Baby, "him doesn't mean her.
Him means the pitcher little girl, <i>her</i>," he went on,
pointing to the young woman, "her gottened her down
for him to see, 'cos him were trying to reach up to
kiss her."</p>

<p>That was why the picture was no longer in the
window then? Where was it? Auntie turned round
as she felt Baby pulling her.</p>

<p>"Her's there," he said, pointing to a chair on
which the picture had been set down hurriedly with
the face the other way. Auntie turned it round.
Dear little face! It smiled at her again with the
pretty half wistful, half wise expression, which had so
taken her fancy. Now it seemed to her to be saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have found him. I knew
where he was. I am so glad to have helped you to
find him;" and when Baby lifted his little face to
kiss, with his rosy living lips, the picture of the child,
who had once been living and loving like him, I can
hardly tell you the strange feeling that went through
auntie's heart.</p>

<p>"She must have been a dear good little girl, whoever
she was," she thought to herself. "It would be
nice to leave a sweet feeling behind one in the world
long after one is dead, such as that little face gives.
I should like to have that picture. I must see
about it."</p>

<p>But to-day there was no time to be wasted.</p>

<p>Auntie took Baby by the hand, persuading him to
let her carry the precious jugs, as Minet and the
money-box were already more than enough for him.
And, even with her help, it was not so easy to manage
at all, and auntie was very glad to meet Mademoiselle
Lucie a little way down the street, and get her to
carry part.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lucie was delighted, as you can
fancy, to see Herr Baby again. She had been coming
back in great trouble to look for auntie; for very unluckily,
as she thought, she had found that her brother
was out, and she had not therefore gone to the police
office.</p>

<p>"A very good thing, after all," said auntie; "it
would only have been giving trouble for nothing, as
we have found him."</p>

<p>But she said to Mademoiselle Lucie, in a low
voice, to say nothing about the police before Herr
Baby, as it might frighten him.</p>

<p>"Would it not, perhaps, be a good thing to frighten
him a little?" said Mademoiselle Lucie; "he would
not run off again."</p>

<p>Auntie shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not in that way," she said. "We will make him
understand how he has frightened <i>us</i>. That will be
the best way."</p>

<p>"How did he mean to get home alone, I wonder,"
said Mademoiselle Lucie; "how could he have carried
all he had, and Minet too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," said auntie. "How
did you mean to carry everything home, Baby
dear?"</p>

<p>Baby looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Him doesn't know," he said. "P'r'aps him thought
Minet would carry some," he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>Auntie smiled too. Mademoiselle Lucie looked up
for auntie to explain to her, for she did not understand
Baby's talk any better than he did hers.</p>

<p>Suddenly another idea struck auntie.</p>

<p>"How did you manage to tell the old man in the
shop what you wanted to buy?" she said.</p>

<p>Baby considered.</p>

<p>"Him sawed the pitty little girl," he said; "her
was looking at the shiny glasses&mdash;<i>always</i>&mdash;her was
keeping them for him. Him asked her to. Then
him touched them; him climbed up on a chair in the
shop and touched them, and then him showed all
him's pennies to the old man; but the lady wif the
baby knowed the best what him wanted. Her were
very nice, but the pitty little girl were the goodest,
weren't her?"</p>

<p>Auntie listened quietly, for Baby spoke quite
gravely.</p>

<p>"It would be nice to have that pretty picture,
wouldn't it, Baby?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baby; but he didn't look <i>quite</i> pleased.
"Auntie," he said, "him doesn't like you to call her a
<i>pitcher</i>. Him thinks her's a <i>zeal</i> little girl, a zeal
fairy little girl. Her tookened care of the shiny
glasses so nice for him, didn't her?"</p>

<p>And auntie smiled again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By this time, of course, it was quite dark. It had
been quite light when auntie and Mademoiselle Lucie
set off, but at Santino the darkness comes on very
quickly. Poor Baby, he <i>would</i> have been in trouble
if auntie had not come to look, for him&mdash;- that is to say
if the old man and the young woman had allowed
him to set off on his journey home alone. I don't
think he would ever have got there, for in the dark
he could not have found his way, and he certainly
could never have got the shiny jugs and Minet and
the money-box all home in safety!</p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen who were coming to
dine at the Villa had all arrived. Mother was sitting
in the drawing-room talking to them, and trying her
best to look as if there was nothing the matter, to
prevent grandfather finding out that there was. Poor
mother, it was not very easy for her, was it? Grandfather
was a good deal put out, as it was, at auntie's
being so late. He, too, tried not to look cross, poor
old gentleman, but any one who knew him at all well
could not help seeing as he moved about the room,
sometimes giving a poke to the wood fire which was
burning quite brightly as it was, sometimes sharply
pulling open one of the window-shutters and looking
out, as if he could see anything with the light inside
and the dark out of doors!&mdash;any one could see that
he <i>was</i> very much put out. He sat down now and
then for a minute or two and spoke very politely&mdash;for
grandfather was a <i>very</i> polite old gentleman&mdash;to one
or other of the stranger ladies, but even to them he
could not help showing what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"It is very strange, really most exceedingly
strange, of my eldest daughter," he said, "not to be
in before this. I really feel quite ashamed of it, my
dear Madam."</p>

<p>"But you are not uneasy, I hope," said the lady,
kindly. "There cannot be anything the matter with
Miss Leonard?" ("Miss Leonard" was what Fritz
called auntie's "stuck-up name," and "Lady Aylmer"
was mother's.) "You don't feel uneasy about her?"</p>

<p>(This lady did not know there <i>was</i> anything the
matter, for she was quite at the other end of the room
from mother. Mother had whispered to the lady
beside her, who was an old and dear friend, how
frightened she was about Herr Baby, and the old
lady, who was very kind and nice, was talking
and smiling as much as she could to help poor
mother.)</p>

<p>"Uneasy," said grandfather, rather sharply, and
not <i>quite</i> so politely as he generally spoke, "oh no,
of course I'm not <i>uneasy</i>. My daughter Helen
can take care of herself. I am only very much
surprised at her doing such an extraordinary thing
as forgetting the hour like this."</p>

<p>But in his heart I fancy what the lady said did
make grandfather begin to think there might be
something to be uneasy about, and this made him
still crosser. She was not such a sensible lady as
old Mrs. Bryan in the arm-chair opposite, who
chattered the more the more she saw grandfather's
worried look grow worse, and the pain grew plainer
on poor mother's white face.</p>

<p>"May," he called out at last, "I think it is nonsense
waiting dinner any longer. Tell one of the
children to ring and order it up at once. Why,
they're not here! Why are none of the children
down, May? Everything seems at sixes and
sevens."</p>

<p>"We are not waiting for Nelly, father dear," said
mother. "I don't know why dinner isn't ready yet,
but I think it can't be long. I will hurry them,"
and she got up to ring herself.</p>

<p>"But the children&mdash;why aren't they down?" said
grandfather again.</p>

<p>Mother hesitated&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is rather late for them," she said. "The girls
have been a long walk and are tired."</p>

<p>She did not know what to say, poor thing. She
had not dared to let the three children come into the
drawing-room, for fear their white faces and red eyes
should make grandfather find out that there <i>was</i>
something wrong, and indeed neither Celia, nor
Denny, nor Fritz, would have been able to stay still
in the room for five minutes. They were peeping
out of the nursery every few seconds, running along
to the end of the balcony, and straining their eyes
and ears in trying to see or hear anything coming in
the shape of good news.</p>

<p>Long, long afterwards they used to speak in the
nursery, with deep breaths, of "that <i>terrible</i> evening
when Herr Baby was lost."</p>

<p>But it was, of course, the worst for poor mother.
It was bad enough in the nursery, where the tea, that
nobody had cared to touch, was set out as neatly as
usual on the table; the chairs drawn round, the one
that Baby always had with a footstool on it&mdash;to make
up for there being no high chair at the Villa&mdash;in its
place, though the well-known, funny little figure was
not perched on it. And Lisa, with a face swollen so
that no one would have known her, fussing away to
have the kettle boiling, so that her darling should
have some hot tea as soon as ever he came in&mdash;for
she wouldn't allow but that he would soon come in,
though sad little stories kept running through Celia's
and Denny's heads about children that had been lost
and never found, or found only when it was no longer
they themselves but only their poor little bodies,
drowned, perhaps, or "choked in the snow," as
Denny said. And she got rather cross when Celia
reminded her that there was no snow, so it couldn't
be <i>that</i>, any way.</p>

<p>All this was bad enough, but still they were free
to talk about their fears, and to cry if they felt
inclined, and to keep running to the window or the
door. But for poor mother, as you can fancy, it was
<i>much</i> worse. There she had to sit smiling and talking
as if everything were quite nice and comfortable,
not only for the sake of the friends who had come to
dine with them, but still more for poor grandfather's
sake, who kept growing more and more fidgety and
put out, and at the bottom of his heart, though he
would not own it even to himself, really frightened
and anxious.</p>

<p>At last his patience was exhausted.</p>

<p>"May," he said, speaking across the fireplace to
mother. She was talking to the lady beside her, and
did not at first hear him. "<i>May</i>," said grandfather
again, and if the children had been in the room I
think his voice would have made them jump, "it is
using our friends very badly to keep them waiting
so long for dinner. Be so good as to ring again and
tell the servants we will <i>not</i> wait any longer."</p>

<p>Poor mother&mdash;she looked up&mdash;it was all she could
do not to burst into tears!</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I will tell them."</p>

<p>She was half rising from her seat, whispering to
the lady beside her (the lady who <i>did</i> know all about
it), "I don't know <i>how</i> I shall get through dinner,"
when&mdash;what was it?&mdash;no bell had rung, there was
no sound that any one else heard, what could it have
been that <i>mother</i> heard? I don't know what it was,
and I daresay mother herself could not have told, but
something she did hear. For she stopped short, and
a sort of eager look came into her eyes and a flush
into her cheeks. And then the other people in the
room seemed to catch the infection, and everybody
else looked up to see what was coming, and in
the silence a sort of fumbling was heard at the door.
It only lasted a second or two, then somehow the
handle turned, much more quickly than was usually
the case when it was Baby's small hands that were
stretching up to reach it&mdash;I rather think some one
must have been behind to help him&mdash;the door opened
and&mdash;oh such a funny little figure came in! You
know who it was of course, but it would be very difficult
to tell you exactly what he looked like. He was
dressed just as he had been for playing in the garden&mdash;a
little short thick jacket over his holland blouse,
which was no longer very clean; his short scarlet
socks and oldest boots on his legs, the bare part of
which looked very red and cold, and what had been
his best straw hat with part of the brim dangling
down, on his curly head. But he seemed quite
pleased with himself&mdash;that was another of Herr
Baby's "ways"; he always did seem quite pleased
with himself, best of all, I think, when he had his
oldest clothes on&mdash;he trotted into the room just as he
would have trotted into the garden, even though there
were a good many rather finely-dressed ladies and
gentlemen sitting round&mdash;for his whole mind was
filled with the thoughts of two big paper parcels
which he carried in his arms. They could not have
been as heavy as they were big, or else he could not
possibly have carried them! And close at his heels,
making him look still funnier, came Minet, very
pleased, I am sure, to find herself again in sight of
a fire.</p>

<p>Herr Baby looked round him for a moment, only
for a moment, for though the lights in the room and
the number of people dazzled and puzzled him a little,
<i>he</i> did not need to look round for which was mother.
Forgetting all about everything, except that her baby
was found, up jumped mother, a rosy flush coming
over her face which had looked so white and sad,
pretty mother with her silvery silky dress and her
sweet eyes filled with tears, and rushing over to Baby
caught him up in her arms, poor little cold, tired, red-legged
Herr Baby, and for a minute or so, greatly to
grandfather's surprise, she hid her face somehow
among the wee man's curls without speaking.</p>

<p>Grandfather was surprised but not alarmed, for
just behind in the open doorway stood auntie, who
came quietly forward and explained to him that Baby
had gone out on his own account and they had been
afraid of his losing his way, that was what had kept
her out so late, and she was <i>so</i> sorry. Auntie had
such a nice clear simple way of speaking, grandfather's
vexation seemed to melt away as he listened.
He glanced at the little figure still clasped in mother's
arms, and a queer look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor children!" he said, "poor children! May,
you should have told me."</p>

<p>But he knew why they hadn't told him. The
ladies and gentlemen came round auntie to hear
what she was saying. They were all very kind and
very sorry and very glad. But it was difficult not
to smile when a little voice was heard saying,</p>

<p>"Mother, p'ease put him down. Him's got somesing
<i>so</i> pitty, but him's afraid of breaking them."</p>

<p>And sliding down to the ground, he managed
somehow to set the two parcels safely on the floor,
and began undoing them. They all watched him, but
he didn't care, and he would let nobody help him.
He got one out at last, and held it up with a beautiful
happiness in his little face.</p>

<p>"See, mother!" he cried, "shiny jugs! Him's
got them all himself wif him's own pennies. Two!
Them's for you, mother, 'cos him boked you's 'nother
ones. Him founded them himself in a shop. Him's
been as quick as him could, 'cos of mother's party, to
make the table pitty."</p>

<p>"My darling," said mother, hugging him again,
and when she looked up half smiling, half crying, and
tried to say to the ladies and gentlemen that she
hoped they would not think her silly, there were tears
in some other eyes besides in hers.</p>

<p>But Herr Baby was quite himself.</p>

<p>"You <i>is</i> p'eased," he said contentedly. "Then
him'll go to tea, for him's raver hungry. But p'ease
put the shiny jugs on the table to make it pitty."</p>

<p>He held up his face for another kiss. Then
grandfather came forward and in his turn lifted the
little truant into his arms.</p>

<p>"He is tired, the poor little man," he said, looking
round: "you are so kind; I should ask you to forgive
our want of politeness, but I am sure you will. I
will be back in a moment."</p>

<p>And it was grandfather himself who carried off
Herr Baby and gave him over to Lisa, weeping for
joy now, as she caught her darling in her arms.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a happy tea in the nursery that night
after all. Baby was very tired, but so exceedingly
pleased with himself that his face grew rosy and his
eyes bright, as if he had only just wakened up in the
morning, as he sat at the table answering all the
questions of Celia and Denny and Fritz and Lisa
about his adventures. How had he found his way?
How had he made the old man understand what he
wanted? Hadn't he been frightened? Had he
been pleased to see auntie? Had he carried Minet
all the way? Oh, there were more questions than
I could tell you&mdash;almost more than Herr Baby could
answer; and Minet, too, came in for a share of the
petting.</p>

<p>When they had got most of their questions
answered, they all found out they were very hungry,
and they set to work at their tea, and for a while
there was silence in the nursery. Suddenly Baby
leant his two elbows on the table and looked
round.</p>

<p>"It were all the pitty little girl that keeped the
shiny glasses for him. Her <i>are</i> so pitty."</p>

<p>"What little girl?" said the children, all together.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the young woman's little girl in the
shop?"</p>

<p>"No," said Herr Baby, "not that kind of little
girl. Him means a little girl up on the wall&mdash;a
<i>pitcher</i> girl; but him thinks her are a <i>fairy</i>."</p>

<p>And having thus given his opinion, Baby looked
round again with great satisfaction, and Celia and
Denny whispered to each other that really Baby sometimes
said very funny things for such a little boy!</p>

<p>They were all dressed as usual, and Denny and
Baby went in to dessert, while Celia and Fritz waited,
as became such <i>big</i> young people, in the drawing-room.
Everybody was very kind to the children, and Baby,
had he been any one else <i>but</i> Herr Baby, would have
been spoilt by all the petting the ladies wanted to give
him. But his eyes were fixed on one thing, or rather
on two things, on the table, one in front of mother at
one end, one in front of grandfather at the other, there
they stood, two queerly-shaped glass jugs, sparkling
and shining with many colours like a rainbow, filled
with the brightest and clearest water which might
have been drawn at a fairy well. And what pleasure
shone in Baby's face as he looked at them.</p>

<p>"You <i>is</i> p'eased?" he said again to mother, as he
bade her good-night.</p>

<p>It was a little difficult for mother to have to make
"him" understand that much as she loved him for
remembering how sorry she had been to have the first
jugs broken, and how sweet she thought it of him to
have got her new ones, that still he must never
again think of doing such things by himself and
without telling or asking any one.</p>

<p>She did not say anything to him that night; she
could not bear to spoil his pretty pleasure, but the
next day she made him understand; and Baby
"p'omised" he would never again set off on his own
account, or settle any plan without asking mother or
auntie, or perhaps Celia, about it.</p>

<p>And so the end of the story of the broken jugs
was quite a happy one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Herr Baby's birthday came in the late spring.
They were all back in England by then. The old
garden was no longer "lonely," for the children's
voices were heard all over it, and the sunlight through
the leaves flickered on to their curly heads as they ran
about in delight, seeking for all their old favourite
corners. The "labbits" were well and happy; Jones
and Thomas had come to meet them at the railway
station with broad smiles on their honest faces; all
the house looked bright and smiling, too, it had been
so well rubbed up to receive them&mdash;altogether Herr
Baby thought "coming back" was a very nice and
happy thing, though he had enjoyed himself so much
at Santino that he told Lisa he didn't think he
would much mind if they <i>did</i> go there again next
winter, when it began to get cold at home, as was
already spoken of, as Santino had done grandfather
so much good this time.</p>

<p>So, as I was saying, it was a very happy little man,
indeed, that woke up in his "own dear little bed,"&mdash;which,
wonderful to say, had not grown too small for
him all the months they had been away,&mdash;on the
morning of Herr Baby's fifth birthday. He could
hardly stand still to be dressed, so eager was he to
run off to mother's room to get her birthday kiss,
and to see the presents which he knew would not
have been forgotten. They turned out even prettier
than he had expected; indeed, it would take me too
long were I to tell you all about the beautiful box of
bricks, big enough to build real houses almost, Baby
thought, from grandfather, and the lovely pair of toy
horses with <i>real</i> hair, in a stable, from mother, and
the coachman's whip to crack at them from Fritz,
and the pair of slippers Celia and Denny had worked
for him, one foot each, and the birthday cake all
snowed over with sugar, and with his name on in
pink, from grandfather and mother together, "'asides
their other presents." It quite took Herr Baby's
breath away to think all these lovely things were
for him; he sat at the nursery table quite unable
to eat his breakfast, something like Fritz the morning
they were starting on their journey, do you remember?
till Lisa persuaded him to eat, by telling him
if he didn't, he would be so tired that he wouldn't
enjoy his birthday at all, which made him set to work
at his bread and milk. Lisa, too, had remembered the
day, for she had made him the prettiest little penny
purse you ever saw, knitted in bright-coloured silk,
so that now he was very well off, indeed, with his
"scented" purse for his gold and silver, and Lisa's one
for pennies and halfpennies, and his money-box to
store up the rest in when the purses were full. He
had all his presents set out in a row, so that he could
see them while he was eating, and just when he was
at nearly the last spoonful, he was quite startled by
a voice beside him, saying, "And what about <i>my</i>
present, Baby, dear? Did you think I had forgotten
your birthday?"</p>

<p>It was auntie. She had come in so quietly that
Herr Baby had not heard her. She leant over his
chair, and he put his arms round her neck and
kissed her.</p>

<p>"Him is so happy, auntie dear," he said; "him
has such lots of p'esents, him never thought about
your p'esent."</p>

<p>"Didn't you, dear?" said auntie, smiling. "Well,
<i>I</i> didn't forget it&mdash;indeed, I thought of it a long time
ago, as you will see. Come with me, for I see you
have finished your breakfast."</p>

<p>Auntie took him by the hand. Baby wondered
where she was going to, and he was rather surprised
when she led him to his own room&mdash;that is to say,
to the pretty nursery where he and Denny had their
two little white beds side by side.</p>

<p>"Look up, Baby," said auntie.</p>

<p>And looking up, what do you think he saw? On
the wall, at the side of his own little bed, where his
eyes could see it the first thing in the morning, and
the last at night, hung the picture of the blue-eyed
little girl, the dear little girl of long ago, with her
sweet rosy face, and queer old-fashioned white frock,
smiling down at him, with the sort of wise, loving
look, just as she had smiled down at him in the old
shop at Santino.</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, auntie!" cried Baby. But then he
seemed as if he could say no more. He just stared
up at the sweet little face, clasping his hands, as if he
was <i>too</i> pleased to speak. Then, at last, he turned
to auntie and <i>hugged</i> her.</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie!" he said again. "Oh, him <i>is</i> so
p'eased to have him's own pitty little girl always
smiling at him. Him will <i>always</i> have her, won't
him, auntie?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, dear. She is your very own."</p>

<p>"Him will keep her till him is <i>kite</i> old. Him
will show her to him's children and him's g'anchildren,
won't him?" went on Baby solemnly.</p>

<p>"I hope so, dear," said auntie again, smiling at
his flushed little face.</p>

<p>"Her <i>is</i> so pitty," said Baby. "Her is as sweet
as a fairy. Auntie, him would <i>so</i> like to hear
all the story about her. Couldn't you find it out,
auntie?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said auntie, "or, what would be still
better, perhaps the little girl will whisper it to you
some night when you are asleep."</p>

<p>"That <i>would</i> be nice," said Baby. Then another
thought struck him. "Auntie," he said, "will you
ask mother to let him bring up the shiny jugs to
show them to the pitty little girl? Her would like
to see them so nice, and not brokened at all wif the
packing. Oh, auntie, what a bootiful birfday&mdash;him
are <i>so</i> happy!"</p>
